<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">The 1776 Prussian Mennonite Census published in Penner's book lists a Michael Dickgres in Kalthof, Marienburg. The Mennonites living there belonged to the Flemish church and were members of the Heubuden congregation. In fact we find Michael mentioned in the Heubuden Church Book in connection with two marriages.  We also see records of several children that appear to be Michael's. He is associated with a son, Peter, born in 1761 and from this information it is assumed Michael was born around 1740.  The Elbing baptism records list a Peter Dykgraf, son of Michael Dykgraf, baptised in Krebsfeld in 1781. In the Elbing Marriage Book Peter is listed (1785) marrying Helena Dyck and once again his father Michael is mentioned.  <br><br>I have also seen the name spelled Teichgraf and Deichgraf.<br><br>H. Schapansky says Peter is the son of Michael Teichgraf. There is a baptism record in the Elbing Church Book that supports this (1781) mentioning his father Michael.<br><br>According to the census Michael was a self employed tailor.  With him were a wife and daughter.  These would be his second wife whom he married in Traalau in 1774 and probably a daughter from his first marriage; the Heubuden Church Book doesn't list any daughters born after 1774 until 1778 but there is a record of another potential daughter, Anna, baptised in 1790 (and therefore born around 1769). This record is in the Heuebuden Church Baptism Records and the family lived in Marienburg.<br><br>The Heubuden Church Book gives us the name of Michael's second wife, Helena or Magdelena.  My hypothesis is that the marriage and death listings associated with this woman refer to the same person, although it is strange that her name would not be more similar in the two entries. On 8 October 1778 twins are born in Kalthof and the next day the death of a woman whom I believe to be Michael's wife is recorded. There is a discrepancy in the names; the wife's name in the marriage record is Henlane and in the death record Magdalena.  I think the first entry is intended to be Helena, a name frequently also twinned, and used interchangeably, with Magdalena. <br><br>A year later Michael remarries in Usnitz.  This record is remarkable in that the name of the wife is apparently added many years later in a different style.  The name is Anna Dick.  His third wife was Anganetha and I believe the entry reflects an incorrect recollection of the first name but possibly a correct surname. The Grandma Database appears to agree with my assertion. <br><br>Anganetha's children for whom we have a birth record were born at Usnitz. After 1786 it isn't clear where the children were born. <br><br>Geography notes: Traalau, Kalthof, Usnitz and Marienburg are all tightly clustered towns. Krebsfeld is an outlier and the appearance of Michael's son Peter there in 1781 is an anomaly, both because of the distance and because Michael appeared to be living in Usnitz continuously from 1779 through 1786, based on his marriage record and the registers of children's births thereafter. It is possible that Peter was in Krebsfeld to work and was baptized there as a result. It would then follow that Peter could have been living with relatives in Krebsfeld. Johann and Abraham were both in Krebsfeld at this time.<br><br>The Grandma Database cites Prussian emigration records for September 1796 indicating that Michael was not a landowner and had never owned land. This is a factor in the eligibility for emigration, because landowners were not permitted to emigrate at the time. Also mentioned is that in May 1796 the family lived in the poor house in Heubuden. This indicates a remarkably impoverished state. Apparently Michael signed his emigration application with 'x's rather than a signature, implying that he was illiterate. This citation also implies that Michael was born around 1746, a date that is anomolous with the birth year of his first son Peter in 1761. <br><br>Michael died in Prussia after 1799 (the year of birth of his last child).  His wife, Anganetha, moved to Molotschna, Ukraine with seven children.  She is listed as a widow but within a year she remarries and we find her and her children living with the new husband, Abraham Neudorf.<br><br>Michael's son David appears in the 1835 Molotschna census, listed at Montau #25, the home of his step-father, Abraham Neudorf.  He must have had a previous wife, since he is listed in the census as having several stepchildren with the surname of Wiens.  The 1835 census gives his age as 35, indicating that he was born about 1800.<br><br>Hans and Abraham Dickgrew are also listed in the 1776 census and probably the three men are related, although there is scant hard evidence except for DNA evidence.  We can see from the DNA results for descendants of Johann (Hans) and Michael that they have a common ancestor but they may not be brothers. The DNA mutations are slight but sufficient to prohibit a firm conclusion that they are siblings.  One other slight mutuation occurred in Michael's descendants, possibly as early as his son Daniel.   <br><br>There are people who hypothesize that Johann (Hans), Abraham, Michael and another person, Peter Michael Teichroeb, are brothers. Peter is interesting in that his middle name, derived from the Molotshna Census of 1835, establishes a circumstantial linkage to Michael. Michael and Peter both came from Kalthof while Abraham and Johann came from Krebsfeld. Peter is definitely not the same person as Michael's son Peter - there are separate census and immigration records for the two people. <br><br>Michael's son Peter from his first marriage was a signatory to a letter written in 1793 (dated 3 September 1793) attempting to get Elder David Epp removed from office. Other signatories included Jacob Bartsch and Johann Sawatsky, two other ancestors of mine, and Johann Krahn, brother of another of my ancestors, Bernhard Krahn. While the attempt failed it is interesting that so many of my family members were involved in the effort to defrock David Epp. <br><br>According to an old article in Mennonitische Rundschau (an old Canadian Mennonite news publication) the Teichgraf name originates in Nord Friesland.  This is possibly a reference to the Friesland area of the Netherlands that is composed of a large area in the north area of Netherlands.  The Dreifrieslands area in the north of the Netherlands was a primary origin of Mennonites, who left the Netherlands in the 1500's.  Henry Schapansky has researched the Dutch origin of the name and in his article "The Bergthaler / Chortitzer / Sommerfelder Dyck / Duecks" he says that the name was originally Dyckgraf.  It could also have been Dijkgraaf based on the Dutch spellings I have seen. I have also seen Dutch references to Dijkgraef.  Either way it is a concatenation of the words overseer and dyke.  Henry says the name evolved over time to Deichgraf, Theichgraf, Theichrob and Theichgrow. The spelling changed but the pronunciation remained fairly constant.<br><br>Having noted the foregoing information about the origin of the name, there is another possibly geographic origin. Nord Friesdland was a province in Denmark in the 17th century. We see the name in Friedrichstadt where Remonstrants and Mennonites settled at the behest of the Danish Crown. <br><br>There is a death record for a Hans Teichgraber Jr. in 1694 in Bohnsack, Danziger Niederung. The burial date on the record is 25 July 1694. The data appears in the Evangelische Kirche Bohnsack records. This information is from FHL Film Number 208033, and was brought to my attention by Scot Sheppard (Mennonite Genealogy and History Facebook Group). Whether Teichgraber is a variation on Teichgraf is open to speculation. The literal translation of teichgraber is "pond digger".<br><br>The Flemish Mennonite Church was one of the two major branches of the Mennonite Church. The other branch was the Frisian Mennonite Church.  The Flemish Church was more conservative or traditional and in some communities two churches coexisted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Anganetha was the Widow Dueckgroeb who migrated in 1803 with seven children to the Molotschna Colony from Heubuden, Prussia.  Rempel has the information relating to her conveyance papers issued by the government in Grodno on 15 August 1803 and lists her children and the monies received for the purchase of food and cattle feed in accordance with the settlement agreement (about 112 rubles). Her eldest son Johann is shown as the head of the family. By 1804 she was married to Abraham Neudorf, a man about 20 years younger.  <br><br>It is curious that Michael's second wife was Helena Dyck. I wonder if Anganetha and Helena were sisters.<br><br>Settlement in the Ukraine<br><br>The first major wave of Mennonite migration from Prussia to Ukraine occurred primarily between 1789 and 1795 to the Chortitza region southwest of the Dneiper River.  The original group of settlers migrated in the period of 1789-1790 when the first 228 households moved from Prussia. There followed a second group of settlers in the period of 1793-1795 when about 57 households migrated.  There was sporadic migration to Chortitza thereafter. Fourteen towns were established in Chortitza.  There were many reasons for the migration. There was a shortage of land available in Prussia and the quest for arable farmland was a strong motivator.  Further, under the Edict of 1789 the Mennonites were forbidden to acquire land without meeting the Cantonal obligation to provide military service.  Until the Edict this obligation had always been waived.  Concurrently there was a major economic enterprise driven by the Russian government to attract Mennonites from Danzig through the offer of free land in the Ukraine. <br><br>The migrant settlers often traveled by ship from Danzig through Riga and then overland by wagon to collecting camps from which they were allotted land, money, food, equipment, and lumber to establish homesteads. Some settlers had sufficient resources to transport their property themselves from the ships. Often, however, they had to resort to hiring commercial agents to transport their goods and frequently these families saw little or nothing of their possessions after setting off on the overland portion of the trip. The early years were challenging.<br><br>The second major wave of migration began principally in the 1803-1805 period when the 19 towns in Molotschna, to the southeast of Chortitza, was established.  This wave was once again in pursuit of land, and bolstered by further tightening of freedoms in Prussia.<br><br>The Napoleanic Wars caused migration to slow dramatically.<br><br>The third major wave began around 1818 and continued for some time on a gradual basis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Johann came to Ukraine as a youngster and at the age of 17 in 1795 was the head of the household in Schoenhorst with his four siblings. His father died between 1789 and 1792 and his mother married David Isbrecht. She moved to David's homestead and when David died she married a Jacob Epp and moved to his homestead. Johann inherited his father's homestead on Jacob's death but according to the Chortitza Census of 1801 he didn't have full title to the homestead; probably it was shared with his mother.  Johann appears in the 1848 list of Chortitza householders. He is listed in the diary of Jakob Wall as having died on 11 April 1848, presumably in Neuendorf where Wall lived.  Johann and Anna Peters were married sometime between the months of January and May of 1803, in Schoenhorst, in accordance with the 1803 Chortitza vital records.<br><br>The Grandma Database gives us the name of a second wife, Helena Niebuhr. This person is also documented by Schapansky, but not as Johann's wife. The only substantiating evidence that she was married to Johann is correspondence with Marcy Bryon who told me that Helena had a daughter, Justina, who was a Niebuhr, but was referred to in Peter Goertzen's genealogy of Peter Teichroeb as Justina Wolf. The Wolf, according to Marcy, was Johann Wolf who married Helena after his first wife, Anna Peters, died. Goertzen's genealogy does refer to her as Justina Wolf and there is a handwritten entry saying she was the daughter of Niebuhr. I have not found a reference to the father and Helena is the daughter of Jacob Niebuhr, leading me to conclude Justina is a daughter of Johann Wolf. Certainly a careful analysis of autosomal DNA matches between Justina's descendants and my father, Peter Teichroeb, indicates Justina was a daughter of Johann. This analysis is based on ancestry.ca data that has been adjusted for endogamy using the Timber algorithm and compared with matches from all available data for her half siblings. Even after setting longest segment match thresholds at 15 or 20 cM the results are convincing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">In the 1835 Census, he is listed at Wernersdorf and it says he came to Ukraine in 1818, and moved to Wernersdorf from the Chortitza Colony in 1825.  Only his son Jacob is recorded in the 1835 Census entry.  H. Schapansky concurs that he came to Ukraine in 1818 but records in Peter Rempel's book indicate he may have arrived in Molotschna in 1819. It appears that the family lived in Schweingrube until 1805 and then moved to Montauerweide. From there they moved to Ukraine. They probably stayed in Schoenhorst, Chortitza Colony on their way to Molotschna, based on comments in Rempel.<br><br>Rempel says his family consisted of two males and three females.  This only partially matches what we know about his family. He and his wife would have been accompanied by son Jacob and daughter Elisabeth.

<p style="margin-left:1in">I think Anna was with Abraham when the family migrated to Ukraine. Rempel says the family consisted of 2 males and 3 females. We know Abraham and son Jacob were part of the group and son Peter emigrated on his own. Daughter Anna was already married before the family emigrated and so she was not part of the family unit in Rempel's book. Daughter Margarita died as an infant in 1805. This leaves Anna and her daughters Catarina and Elizabeth. Consequently Anna must have emigrated with her family.<br><br>There is an entry in the Tragheimer Gemeinde records for a Catarina Abrams who was baptized in 1832 in Boenhoff. She was the daughter of an Abraham Abrams. This must not be the daughter of Abraham and Anna because the baptism age (31) is very unusual. In addition, it would mean the family left her alone, unmarried, at the age of eighteen when they emigrated. This is difficult to believe.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Bernhard's first wife was Katharina Andres. Bernhard and Katharina were probably married in 1795. Katharina is recorded as Bernard's first wife and the mother of Maria and Anna in the notes to the 1811 Chortitza Census. H. Schapansky tells us Bernhard was baptized in 1794 and their children arrived in 1797 and 1798. Johann Rempel's Family Book just says they were married in 179..  Katharina was a sister of Anna, who married Bernhard's brother Johann. Katharina died in November 1800 according to Johann Rempel.<br><br>H. Schapansky says he came to Ukraine in 1795-1796 and his brother, Johann, came to Ukraine at the same time.  Johann is listed in the 1793-1795 list of original settlers assembled by Glenn Penner. I think Bernhard was with Johann in that household.<br><br>Bernard was subsequently married to Maria in 1801, probably in Rosenthal. By the time of the September 1801 Census they were already married. Maria is the mother of Margaretha. When Bernhard died Maria married Daniel Teichroeb (born 1789). Stumpp lists Bernard as a tailor from Klein Mausdorf, Grosses Werder in 1795 who moved to Burwalde, Chortitza.  He was in Rosenthal in 1801 and 1802 and in Burwalde in 1803, 1806, 1808.  H. Schapansky says that he was the son of Johan Krahn of Neustadterwald and came to Ukraine in 1795 - 1796.  The 1801 census indicates he was a tailor.  The Grandma Database says he died between 1808 and 1813; probably the year was 1813, the year Maria remarried. I suspect he died in Burwalde because the Vital Records indicate this is where Daniel Teichroeb married his widow.<br><br>Notes about the first wife of Bernhard, Katharina Andres<br><br>Her father was Jacob Andres. A Jacob Andreas, born about 1740, lived in Rosenthal in 1808. Schapansky says he was also there in 1802 and 1803 having emigrated from Walldorff, Elbing District, Prussia in 1795. The 1776 Prussian Mennonite census lists him as living in Powunden; H. Schapansky indicates he was a member of the Ellerwald Gemeinde but I can't substantiate this. It records 4 sons and 2 daughters at the time.  He was a farmer described as a landowner in poor circumstances. The 1789 Prussian census list him in Munsterburg/Marienburg. Schapansky says he moved to Lackendorff and then to Gartenkamp in the region of the Rosenort Gemeinde. According to Stumpp, he moved to Rosentau/Taurien in 1795, but this village was not established until 1804. Jacob was a farm labourer.  In 1808, he had a son, Jacob (b. 1774), living with him as well as a grandson, Jacob Krahn (b. 1786), and his grandson's wife, Magdalena (b. 1788). He was a Flemish Mennonite. The Grandma Database provides his date of death based on genealogical contributions.<br><br>Her mother was Anna Klassen. According to Schapansky an Altester Wiebe mentioned that Jakob Andres, husband of Anna, was the brother in law of a Johann Klassen of Insel Chortitza, who in turn was the son of Johann Klassen of Neustadterwald.<br><br>She had a brother, Kornelius. Kornelius came to Rosenthal from Krebsfeld, Elbing in 1795.  In 1808, he was living there with his wife, Anna (b. 1778), and their children, along with a servant girl named Susanna Ensz (b. 1788).  The Grandma Database cites Johann Rempel (1921, p. 13) who says that Kornelius was born 31 October 1766.<br><br>She had a brother, Johann. Johann lived in Einlage in 1802 and 1808. The Grandma Database has a reference to material published by Johann Rempel (1921, p. 13) indicating Johann was baptized in 1788.<br><br>Grosses Werder was part of the Danzig Gemeinde until 1639.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">The discovery of Bernhard Friesen and Susanna Penner was made after a detailed analysis of autosomal DNA matches that appeared on ancestry.ca. The conclusion they were correct ancestors was made after comparing DNA from known descendants of their daughter Helena (1798) with DNA from descendants of potential siblings. After filtering to remove the effects of endogamy using the Timber algorithm and using a longest segment match threshold of 15 cM it is clear the group of people reviewed were descendants of a group of siblings, of which all but Helena had been previously identified as children of Bernhard and Susanna. It follows that Helena is also one of the siblings and a child of Bernhard and Susanna. The genealogical data corresponds to this conclusion because we know the age of Helena and therefore the accuracy of the scenario appears to be reasonable.<br><br>Rempel indicates the family immigrated in 1804 and Unruh indicates they settled on their land in 1805. They emigrated from the village of Waldorf in the Tiegenhagen area of Prussia. Unruh indicates they originated in Vierzehnhuben. Bernhard is listed in Vierzehnhuben in the 1789 Prussia Land Census.<br><br>The family settled on Blumenort #19. We see Bernhard and Susanna with all the children in the 1806 census. In the 1811 census Bernhard is listed as a tailor. Susanna is not in the census, indicating she died earlier. Bernhard's wife is listed as Helena, but I think this is an error because daughter Helena is not listed in that census. In the 1814 census Helena is listed as a daughter and there is no wife listed for Bernhard.<br><br>Bernhard must have died before 1835 because the census of that year shows his son, Heinrich, along with Heinrich's family, as the householders on Blumenort #19.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He was a member of the Flemish Gemeinde but the origin of the family is from the Frisian Gemeinde.  His birth date is taken from the 1811 Elbing Census. Hermann was 58 in that census, living in Kerbshorst.  The census records a wife aged 33, a son aged 6 and a daughter aged 2.  He was a carpenter. <br><br>Most of the children are found in church records and data is rounded out by the many-roads.com genealogy. The information about Kornelius (1786-1801) is from the Grandma Database and may be incorrect. There is an indication of two other children (1805-1811 and 1809-1811).  No other details are available.<br><br>Hermann's second wife, Anna Heinrichs, has birth, baptism and marriage records in the Marcushof church records. She is listed in the 1811 Elbing Census although not by name. Further there is a record of their marriage in the "Kingdom of Prussia and State of Prussia, Germany, Selected Lutheran Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1661-1944". For the later I do not have a specific reference, only an ancestry.ca reference. Notes for her father: Jacob is listed in the Tiensdorf and Marcushof Church Book. His baptism appears in 1777, although I can not make out the month. His wedding to Anna Ketler appears in 1780. Notes for her mother: In the Thiensdorf and Marcushof Church Records there are two young women with the name Ketler who are married on 2 May 1780. Both are from Kerbshorst. Probably they were sisters. There is a baptism record for a Barbara Ketler, daughter of Cornelius, in 1779 (pp. 14-15). In 1778 Heinrich Ketler, son of Cornelius is baptised (pp. 6-7). Barbara and Heinrich were from Thiergarth at the time of the baptisms. The 1776 census lists Cornelius living in Thiergarth with a wife, one son and two daughters. In 1780 Barbara is listed again as being baptised; she is still listed as living in Thiergarth as the daughter of Cornelius (pp. 18-19). I think the double entry implies that one of the records is for daughter Anna. It seems unlikely that there were two householders named in Cornelius with daughters named Barbara at the same time. Certainly the 1776 census does not list two such individuals. The Church Book lists another son, Cornelius, from the same town baptised in 1782 (pp. 30-31). This runs contrary to the 1776 census.<br><br>The port at Elbing, along with the port at Danzig, were two maine disembarkation points for Mennonites fleeing western Europe by sea.  The earliest settlements in Elbing were established in the middle to late 1500's and citizenship was first granted to Mennonites in Elbing in 1585.  In later years there were Frisian and Flemish Mennonites in the area, the Frisians belonging to the Thiensdorf - Marcusoff Gemeinde.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Michael is undoubtedly the father of Jacob.  In the 1801 Chortitza Census we see Jacob and sister Maria at Neuendorf #23 with their mother Maria Bueckert and her new husband Jacob Peters.  The comments made by the people transcribing the material tell us the children were Michael's. Furthermore, as noted in the commentary about Jacob, there is ample DNA evidence to support the position that Jacob is the common ancestor.<br><br>Henry Schapansky tells us that Michael was the son of Heinrich of Neustadterwald and a member of the Tiegenhagen Church.  The 1776 census tells us Heinrich had three sons. Michael and Jacob would be two of them.  There were two later sons mentioned in the Grandma Database.  The third son in the 1776 census is unknown.<br><br>Heinrich migrated to Ukraine in 1789 and died before 1793; in fact he probably died in 1789 before even reaching Chortitza because he does not appear in the First Settlers work done by Glenn Penner.  In 1795 Michael was living with a Peter Dyck in Neuendorf; Michael was employed as a servant. This was the revision list for settlers of 1789 and I conclude Michael was among those earliest settlers. There is no sign of Michael's mother except census information to the effect that when she died her Einlage homestead was left to her daughter and son-in-law. These were Helena Rempel and Cornelius Willems. Therefore we know that Heinrich Loewen's wife had been married first to a Rempel. For an analysis of the disposition of the family upon arrival at Chortitza, see the notes for Heinrich Loewen.<br><br>After Michael married Maria Bueckert he took over the homestead of her deceased father, Daniel Bueckert. The homestead later went to Maria's new husband, Jacob Peters, after Michael died and she remarried. <br> <br>Michael is mentioned in comments in numerous Chortitza Census documents after his death, all in connection with his children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Maria's parents must have died before 1795; that year she is found with her brother, Jacob, and sister, Anna, in Neuendorf. In Unruh there is an indication that a young girl, Anna, aged 8, lived with them but I think this is an error in interpreting the data because the same entry also refers to Anna, age 15, being the sister of Maria. Certainly the 1795 census seems to be clear that the Anna listed in the household is aged 15. Maria's birth record is found in the Heubuden Church records.<br><br>Her second husband was Jacob Peters and they assumed the farm in Nieder Chortitza that had belonged to her father Daniel Bueckert. This was recorded in Rempel's book for the year 1806, the same year that Nieder Chortitza was established. That entry says Daniel came to Ukraine in 1789, as is confirmed in information about the first Chortitza colonists.<br><br>Jacob Peters is listed in the 1809 Smallpox Vaccination list with two children.</p>

I assume Johann was born in Wernersdorf.<br><br>Schapansky says that Johann may have lived at Chortitza, Einlage, and/or Ekaterinoslav and may have been a miller. Helmut Huebert's book supports this view of his occupation. I suspect he moved to Ekaterinoslav because there is no record of him in Chortitza when he immigrated. Also of interest is the fact that his future wife also lived in Ekaterinoslav, where her parent moved when they immigrated.<br><br>H. Schapansky points out that Johann and his wife Aganetha Toews were cousins, his mother being Maria Toews. The father of Aganetha Toews was Jacob Toews, the brother of Maria Toews.<br><br>Helmut T. Huebert, in his book "Mennonites in the Imperial Cities of Russia", describes the many business enterprises of Johann Fast and his descendants. Of further interest is the interrelationship of the Fast family with the Toews family and the Heese family and the capital accumulation of this group of families.<br><br>Johann Fast (1800-1841) was married to Aganetha Toews (1803-1862). Johann appears to have operated a treadmill powered flour mill. This mill was most likely in Ekaterinolav or in the Chortitza settlement. After Johann died the operation of the mill was assumed by his son, Jacob (1822-1866). <br><br>Jacob had married Katharina Heese (1816-1848) and, upon her death, her sister Anna Heese (1826-1909). The Heese sisters were daughters of Heinrich Heese (1786-1868), a well known educator and the founder of the Chortitza Zentralschule. Jacob and Anna were living in the Chortitza Settlement when Anna persuaded Jacob to relocate to Ekaterinoslav, where they set up a new milling business. Around 1866 the mill was converted to steam power. <br><br>Jacob died in 1866 and his wife, Anna, ran the mill with their son, Heinrich (1858-1897). Heinrich's brother, Wilhelm (1864-?) joined the business and in later years ran the mill in partnership with Heinrich, and after Heinrich's death took over sole management of the business. In 1890 the mill was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt in the 1894-1897 period. By 1911 the business was insolvent and taken over by the banks to which it was indebted. <br><br>The reasons for bankruptcy are vague, but it seems the investment was huge and highly leveraged. Further, competitors, concerned by the threat posed due to the scale and modern nature of the new operation, spread rumours about the unsafe conditions in the mill and the quality of the product. The financial and reputational damage were more than Wilhelm could withstand. After bankruptcy the operation continued in some form and after the Bolshevik Revolution the business was nationalized. Later when Ukraine gained its independence the company began to operate under the name DMK Dnipromyln LLC. It is still in operation today. The company web site discusses the early years, mentioning Fast by name and describing the challenges with the development of the substantial property and the ensuing bankruptcy.<br><br>Jacob's son, Johann (1849-1908) established a lumber mill in Ekaterinoslav around 1875 and was successful for many years. The business supplied lumber for the flour mill operated by Heinrich and Wilhelm. This was a key source of revenue. When the flour mill failed the lumber mill was severely impacted and eventually became insolvent.<br><br>Following the failure of the lumber mill, Jacob's son, Johann, established an iron foundry in partnership with a son in law. This business was successful until the son in law died, at which point the operation was downsized.<br><br>The family of Aganetha Toews (1803-?) were also engaged in capitalist ventures. Her father, Jacob Toews (1768-?) had a wind powered flour mill in Ekaterinoslav. It was destroyed in a fire around 1807. Jacob's son Heinrich Toews (1819-1867) operated a wind powered mill in Ekaterinoslav in 1836 and 1837. He moved to Einlage in the Chortitza Settlement in 1840 and continued in the business of milling. Later he returned to Ekaterinoslav and in 1857 purchased property that was still in the family of Johann Fast (1800-1841). He built a treadmill powered mill there and ten years later a steam powered mill. He died in 1867 and the business was taken over by his sons, Jacob (1845-1883) and Johann (1841-1915). <br><br>Johann's son, Johann (1869-?) established a soap manufacturing business, financed by his father. Apparently, he was the black sheep of the family. He was caught philandering with one of his servants, by whom he had several children. <br><br>In 1880 Jacob (1845-1883) built another mill and left his brother Johann to operate the earlier mill. Jacob Toews (1845-1883) married Margaretha Heese (1848-1880), daughter of Heinrich Heese (1828-1883) and granddaughter of Heinrich Heese the elder (1786-1868). After Margaretha died Jacob went on to marry her sister, Susanna (1862-1950).<br><br>The Heese family were also successful entrepreneurs. Heinrich Heese (1828-1883), a son of Heinrich Heese (1786-1868), entered the milling business with a treadmill powered mill. When it was destroyed in a fire, he went into the grain marketing business. After the Crimean War global demand for Russian grain was weak and he was unsuccessful. In the late 1860s he built a steam powered flour mill, purchasing machinery from England. He left that business to work as a lawyer, banker, and real estate agent. <br><br>Heinrich's son, Heinrich (1846-1903) established his own flour mill in 1878 in Ekaterinoslav. His business was successful, and he prospered. In later years he was on the board of several private banks and the federal bank. Later his sons, Heinrich, and Peter, took control of the mill and operated it until it was nationalized after the Bolshevik Revolution.<br><br>Another son of Heinrich Heese (1828-1883), Wilhelm (1846-1920) married Maria Fast (1858-1935). Maria was a daughter of Johann Fast (1832-1885) and granddaughter of Johann Fast (1800-1841).</p>

The familiy was still in Einlage in 1797 but they moved to Rosenthal before the 1801 census. Dietrich (1792) was still living at home in Rosenthal in 1816, as evidenced by the census in October of that year. He was still unmarried at that point.

<p style="margin-left:1in">Most of the commentary related to David appears with the comments about his father Wilhelm.  In the 1814 Chortitza Census his occupation is listed as Miller. He appears in the 1847 Census and his wife, Katharina, is listed with her maiden name of Wieler. It appears that in 1858 his sons David and Gerhard moved to Eichenfeld, a village in the new daughter colony of Yazykovo, immediately north of the Chortitza Colony. This new colony was established through the purchase of land from a nobleman named Yazykovo. There is a David Redekopp (two actually) listed in Rosenthal in the 1859 Householder List; presumably David is one of these.<br><br>I have seen his name listed with a middle initial W which I believe represents his father's first name.<br><br>Lorraine Sawatsky Jones has provided information about David's children. The first Maria died as an infant. Her birth date was 1 August 1815 and her date of death was 16 September 1816. Katarina was born on 12 September 1816, married on 10 August 1836, and died on 16 July 1855. According to material published by Johann Rempel (1921, p.26) Katharina died of cholera.

<p style="margin-left:1in">The facts are sparse relating to Helena.  We know that she was the wife of Peter Epp based on records in the Schoenhorst Church Register. Further we know that family recollections have a Helena Goossen as Peter Epp's wife, although the authors of that work were uncertain as to the accuracy of this name. I don't know what sources the authors used but they may have relied on Hermann Thiessen's work.  He has a record of a Helena Goossen whose location information matches Peter Epp exactly, in accordance with great grandson David Epp's Citizenship Certificate.  I think the most reliable information is the church record.<br><br>There is a Helena Goertzen in the Tiegenhagen Church Book, born in Petershagen in 1803 who is very likely the same Helena as Peter Epp's wife. However, I don't know this to be certain. Her parents were Georg Goertzen and Maria Neubauer. Helena's birth record gives her father's name and the 1784 marriage record gives the name of Helena's mother. George died in 1808 in Prussia and there is no indication his wife remarried. Maria appears to have died in 1819 or earlier - there is a record in the Fund Of Orphans data showing the inheritance she left three of her children (Maria, Helena and Johann). This further implies that son Isaac had died before 1819.<br><br>Helena came to Ukraine in 1818 with her older brothers Isaac and Johann and her sister Maria. Unruh has records showing they immigrated on 2 April 1818 and settled in Kronsthal. It appears her brothers later moved to Molotschna, based on the 1835 census.

<p style="margin-left:1in">Information about Peter Dyck is somewhat convoluted. In a number of sources he is shown with two wives, a Maria Nowitzky and a Maria Regier. I believe Maria Nowitzky is incorrect because research has demonstrated she did not exist but was the product of family lore that was not accurate. (See Glenn Penner, "Myths and Legends" in Preservings 2018.) My assumption is that there was just one wife, Maria Regier. We know about Maria Regier because she is shown as the mother of Barbara Dyck in the Reinlander Gemeinde Buch. This also shows that Peter Dyck is Barbara's father.<br><br>Peter was born in 1806 in the village of Chortitza. The family moved to Schoenhorst a year later. By 1811 he had two sisters, Margaretha born 29 June 1807, and Barbara born 1808. His father, Peter, died in 1808 and in the 1808 census we see his mother, Margaretha, alone with the children. By 1810 she has married Heinrich Funk and he has taken over their farm in Schoenhorst. Between 1811 and 1813 the family moved to Neu-Osterwick. In the 1814 census the family is still in Neu-Osterwick but Peter's mother, Margaretha, has died. His sister Barbara was taken in as a foster daughter by Peter Isaac and his wife Katharina who lived at Neuendorf #30. Peter was still at Neu-Osterwick #6 in 1816.<br><br>The 1858 Chortitza Census tells us that Peter Dyck lived at Schoeneberg #12 and confirms that his father was also named Peter. H. Schapansky confirms this to be the case.<br><br>The 1859 Landless List for Chortitza connects sons Heinrich and Peter to their father Peter. It indicates they are registered to Schoeneberg #12 although they live elsewhere. Heinrich lived in Friedrichstal at that time. There apparently is a letter that the elder Peter wrote to his son Heinrich in Friedrichstal to tell him about the death of Maria Regier in 1867.<br><br>Heinrich is also listed in the Sommerfeld Gemeinde Buch and it indicates his father is Peter Dyck.<br><br>The birthdate of his son Abraham may have been 24 May 1849. After immigrating to Canada in 1876, Abraham moved back to the Mennonite settlements in eastern Ukraine some years later to give his children what he considered a proper education. They built a new home in there, which was later used to store food. It must have been a very small house.<br><br>Ben Fast gave me information about Helena Dyck's family, as best he could remember.  He recalled she had a brother Jacob and a brother Abram. Both people are recorded in the Grandma Database. Ray and Helen Fast have told me that when Heinrich Epp and Helena Dyck first came to Saskatchewan, they lived with her brother Abram over the first winter. This is confirmed by information in the book "Waldheim Remembers the Past". Ben also thought one of Helena's sisters married a Jacob Hoeppner.  I do not know if this is correct, but I have not found anyone that fits the description. However, Helena Epp, the daughter of Heinrich Epp (1826) married a Jacob Hoeppner. This might be the couple Ben had in mind.<br><br>The 1880 Village Census of the Mennonite West Reserve includes a reference to Peter Dyck and his son Abram Dyck. This entry tells us Peter was born in Schoeneberg, Chortitza.<br><br>The 1847 Chortitza village list has a Peter Dyck in Schoeneberg recorded as a landowner - it probably is the same person.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He appears in the Bergthaler Gemeinde Buch in 1843.  The death and marriage dates are taken from that source.  Glenn Penner has reported that a Russian document published in 1812 implies that Christoph arrived in Chortitza in 1811 at the age of 28. The 1815 Chortitza Census says this as well. Penner's article says that Christoph was not originally a Mennonite, but he joined the Mennonite migration to Ukraine, and thereafter became a member of the Mennonite Church.<br><br>His first name is given as Karl in the Bergthal Gemeinde Buch on p. A73 and as Karl in the 1822 Chortitza Colony Vital Records in relation to the birth of his daughter Aganetha, where he is found living in Einlage. The Grandma Database says his first name is given as Christoph in the 1835 Chortitza Colony Census (extract found in Odessa Archive, Fond 6, Inventory 1, File 4889).  The Grandma Database goes on to say "In the 1835 Census he was listed at Nieder Chortitza #47.  He apparently moved to Schoenthal, Bergthal Colony with the first settlers of that village about 1837 since he and his family are among a group of Mennonites who expressed a desire to settle in Schoenthal per Odessa Archive, Fond 6, Inventory 1, File 4889." I haven't seen the 1835 Census and I haven't found any traces of Christoph other than the Bergthaler Gemeinde Buch and the Chortitza 1815 and 1816 Census and Vital Records information. I wonder if he was an itinerant laborer until he married and settled down in Nieder-Choritza in 1815.<br><br>The interchangeable first names imply that possibly his father is a Karl or a Christoph.<br><br>Randy Striemer makes a passing reference to Karl without elaboration.  I don't know if his source is unique.<br><br>Christoph's daughter Anna appears in Sommerfeld, Manitoba in the 1881 Census.  The 1901 Canada Census says she was born on 26 November 1828. She arrived in Canada on 30 July 1874 aboard the S. S. Sarmatian.<br><br>His son Carl arrived in Canada on 30 July 1876 on the S. S. Sardinian.<br><br>His daughter Maria arrived in Canada on 27 July 1874 aboard the S. S. Nova Scotian.<br><br>The Bergthal Colony in Ukraine was the first daughter colony of Chortitza.  It was established in 1836 with five villages.  The first, Bergthal, was established that year.  Schoenfeld and Schoenthal were established in 1837, Heubuden in 1839 and Friedensthal in 1852.  Bergthal was the religious center.  These people managed to remain relatively isolated from much of the religious, educational and agrarian renewal movements that swept the Russian Empire in the 19th century, but they eventually became threatened by political pressure for changes in education and military legislation.  This pressure toward modernization and societal integration, coupled with the demand for land, led to the migration in the 1870s of most of the colonists to the Red River area of Manitoba.<br><br>In Bergthal many of the people were landless.  Apparently there were 350 landless families in 1874, comprising about half of the population.  This economic situation made the migration to Canada unaffordable for many families.  Therefore the community as a whole contributed 10 percent of the savings in the local financial institution to cover the costs of moving the landless members.<br><br>Once in Canada, the Mennonites imposed their old hamlet based village pattern, where all residents settled in small hamlets, with farm yards fronting onto a main street and homesteads surrounding the hamlet. While the homesteads were technically registered in the names of the individual homesteaders, the actual organization was based on shared pasturage and a community - based organization of crop lands, supported by the authority of the community church.  This contravened Canadian law where each homesteader was supposed to live on the homestead.   The government permitted the exception, but in practice the arrangement was not stable.  There was constant tension between the rights of the individual owners and the communal structure of the group.  The communal system did not lend itself well to expansion when young people needed to acquire their own land.  Since the wealthier families could buy and register new land, there was little incentive to continue to treat the land as communal property.  Many hamlets fell apart as the new individual based structure was adopted.</p>

As with pandemics generally, human migration, trade and travel contributed to the spread of such widespread events. The first epidemic originated in India and spread through Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe and East Africa. The second affected Europe particularly strongly and even reached North America. These pandemics reached the Russian Empire as well but with less severity than the third epidemic. It erupted in 1846, spreading from Asia northwest through Russia, hitting it with great severity and killing a million people. The southern area of Ukraine north of the Black Sea, colonized by the Dutch Mennonites, was in the path of the pandemic and was not spared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">This person appears variously with the names Magdalena and Helena. Henry Schapansky points out that the names Magdalena and Helena are used interchangeably throughout the genealogy records.  She came to Canada on 22 October 1874 on the S.S. Nova Scotian; she was a widow living with her daughter Maria (wife of Peter Epp) at this time.  She is listed in the 1881 Canadian Federal Census in Schoenthal, Manitoba, still living with her daughter. She may have died on 18 April 1881, based on public genealogy websites that provide no source references. However, the 1881 census was dated 4 April 1881 and usually took up to June to be completed, making it somewhat unlikely she died on the specified date.</p>
