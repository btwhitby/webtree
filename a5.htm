<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>16.  Daniel Teichroeb</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#13"><sup>13</sup></a> son of <a href="a6.htm#i31"><b>Daniel Teichroeb</a></b> <A HREF="sources.htm#49"><sup>49</sup></a> and <a href="a6.htm#i32"><b>Anna Wolf</a></b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#50"><sup>50</sup></a> was born 26 May 1835 in Schoenhorst, Chortitza, Ukraine and died 20 February 1918 in Georgstal, Fuerstenland, Ukraine. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Daniel kept a journal in which he recorded family tree events and a few other important items.  In his journal he spells his name Teigroeb. He noted that in 1877 he had accumulated 3,500 Rubles.  He moved to Georgstal in 1879.  In his book he noted that on 17 February 1879 he was living in Georgstal, and that he had bought his farm for 2,150 Rubles.  Georgstal was a village in the colony of Fuerstenland.  Fuerstenland was a daughter colony of Chortitza, and was founded between 1864 and 1870.  The land within the Fuerstenland settlement was leased from the Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevitch. If Daniel purchased his land then it would have been land located outside the settlement. The average price of land in the period 1863-1872 was 17.3 rubles per dessiatina. In the period 1873-1882 prices had risen to 20.67. I estimate that Daniel paid around 19 rubles for his land. He would have purchased about 110 dessiatinas, placing him in the ranks of the top 12% of landowners in the Russian Empire at the time, who controlled 89% of the land. My grandfather, Dan Teichroeb, recalls that the family farm operation was large, with housing for local farm workers. <br><br>One entry in his journal noted that Daniel Teihreb, who was born on 22 February 1789, died on 5 January 1857.  Although the journal is silent on the relevance of this, the elder Daniel was his father.<br><br>According to Daniel's journal, his son Johann (1871-1942) moved to Orenburg on 24 October 1902 with his four children: Johann, Daniel, Peter, Margaretha. Son Heinrich moved to Orenburg on 5 February 1901. Son Daniel moved to Canada on 10 June 1902 with his ten children.<br><br>Johann Teichroeb (1871-1942) moved to Orenburg in 1902 and lived in Russia for the rest of his life. I have met his great grandson, Jakob Teichrib, online, and learned something about this branch of the family. Johann Teichroeb (1871-1942) was married to Anna Dyck (1872-1922). Anna died in the Orenburg settlement. One of their sons was Jakob Teichrib (1905-1940). He lived in Leninpol, Kyrgyzstan with his wife Frida Henning (1910-1964) and three sons, Victor, Arnold, and Edvin.  Jakob (1905-1940) was arrested by the Russian police and taken to Magadan, Siberia, where he died shortly after his arrest. In 1991 Arnold and his son, Jakob (the great grandson mentioned earlier), moved to Germany.<br><br>I have school photographs dating to the 1930s that show Jakob and Frida with their students. These were provided by Elena Klassen. The location at the time was Aulie - Ata, Turkestan, later called Leninpol.<br><br>Daughter Katharina moved to Canada in 1926. Nothing is known about daughter Maria.<br><br>In 1863 many Chortitza families received loans of grain.  These came from grain stores accumulated by the colony as insurance for crop failure.  There had been a poor harvest the previous year due to heavy snow the preceding winter.  The material related to this is in the records of the Guardianship Committee for Foreign Settlers in South Russia.  There are two lists.  The Signature List contains the signatures of the heads of households who agreed to the loan and the promise to replace the grain at the first opportunity.  The second list is the Grain List and it appears to be the heads of families who took delivery of the grain.  Daniel is listed in both the Grain List and the Signature List and as a land owner in Schoenhorst.<br><br>In a note from Daniel's journal we learn that Heinrich was bit by their dog on 3 December 1870.  It is not clear why this was an event worth recording.  He would have been 4 years old at the time and probably the dog was a typical large farm dog and the injury may have been serious.  Heinrich moved to Orenburg on 5 February 1901.<br><br>Daniel's second wife, Margaretha Schellenberg, had a couple of strokes before she died: 11-12 March 1903; 9 September 1914. The last stroke led to her death.<br><br>Daniel's son Daniel was married to Sara Redekop. The Canadian Mennonite Historical Society lists her as buried in Edenburg, Manitoba. I also have seen records indicating she was buried in Halbstadt, Manitoba. I think she may be buried in the Edenburg cemetery but the connection to Halbstadt is likely the Mennonite Church located there.<br><br>The grave of Daniel's daughter Katharina is located at Archibald Cemetery, Manitou, Pembina Municipality, Manitoba (Billion Graves).</p>

There is no village named in 1888 but they were living in Olgafeld in 1892. His name is mentioned in the Fuerstenland Baptism record for Daniel Teichroeb (b. 1904) where he is recorded as Agatha's father.<br><br>He must have been born in Neuendorf because his parents lived there as early as 1815 and his father died there in 1848.

His wife's obituary says he was about 68 when he died. Therefore if he died around 1892 he must have been born around 1824.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Daniel Teichroeb's journal lists her married name and has her birth and death dates; her last name comes from the Reinlander Gemeinde Buch. <br><br>Anna's obituary in Mennonitische Rundschau appears to be written by one of Anna's sons, Johann. Johann is not connected to her in the Grandma database. However, Ben Fast told me years ago that he believed Agatha Dyck (my great grandmother) had a brother named Johann who was a blacksmith. That was a family trade - Anna Hiebert's husband, Johann Dyck, was a blacksmith. The obituary has a "dateline" of Blumenfeld Post Nikolaipol, in Nepluiev Settlement on the Dnieper River, ten miles from the city of Nikolaipol.<br><br>The obituary says that Anna and Johann lived in Olgafeld, Fuerstenland Colony, where they had a farm. Johann was also a blacksmith and operated a shop to earn extra income. They made ends meet but they were not wealthy. At some point the neighbour's property went up in flames and the fire spread to Johann's blacksmith shop, which also burned. With their business destroyed the couple sold and moved to Michaelsburg where they built a new house and lived with the two unmarried children who had not yet left home. They operated a farm in Michaelsburg. When Johann was about 68 years of age he died. He had been ill for many years with stomach ailments. Later the last of the children married and moved out on there own. Anna employed hired help to run the farm until her death in 1911 at the age of 83 years and 7 months. If the birth date in Daniel Teichroeb's journal is correct then she was actually 84 years and 7 months old when she died. <br><br>The obituary says she was buried on 17 October 1911. Daniel Teichroeb's journal records a death date of 10 October 1911. <br><br>This must have occurred before the youngest son Peter was baptized in 1892, that record saying Johann Nickel was his stepfather. The obituary does not say Anna remarried and her husband is not mentioned.<br><br>Entries in the Reinlander Gemeinde Buch establish the connection between parents Johann Dyck and Anna Hiebert and daughters Helena and Elizabeth, both of whom immigrated to Canada. Teichroeb family records establish the connection between the parents and daughters Maria and Agatha, both of whom were married to Peter Teichroeb and never left Ukraine. The Fuerstenland Baptism Record establishes connections to children Cornelius and Heinrich, who immigrated to Canada, and Maria, Katharina and Peter, who presumably all remained in Ukraine. Certainly Maria remained in Ukraine. A note in the Grandma Database says Peter moved to Siberia. Nothing is known about Katharina after her baptism in 1888.<br><br>The obituary tells us there was another son, Johann. I think he is the Johann Johann Dyck who has numerous children baptized in Alexanderthal (1898 and 1901) and then Michaelsburg (1903 and later), all in the Mennonite Brethren Gemeinde. The Grandma Database indicates his father was a Johann Dyck and his mother was an Anna Suderman but I do not think this is correct.<br><br>Johann says in the obituary that four children went to North America and the others stayed behind. This sounds like a description of the family contained in this analysis.<br><br>The connection between Anna and her parents is established by an entry in Mennonite Rundschau on 7 February 1900 (page 4). This is a letter written by half brother Abraham mentioning siblings, one of whom is referred to as widow Johann Dyck of Michaelsburg. This information in the context of other information submitted to the Grandma Database establishes a high level of confidence in Anna's parentage.<br><br>Translation of the letter and mapping to known siblings:<br><br>Plum Coulee, January 24, 1900. Dear Rundschau! I would like to ask you to take a few lines from me and send them in your columns to Russia to my brothers and sisters who live in different places. Namely to Peter Hiebert, Orenburg; Franz and Cornelius Hiebert in Charkossche; Heinrich Peters, Fuerstenland, Georgsthal; widow Johann Dyck, Michaelsburg; Johann Harms, Nieder-Chortitza; Jakob Friessen, Einlage. Dear brothers and sisters, let us hear from you, either through the "Rundschau" or by letter. Thank God we are still healthy, which we wish for you too. Our family currently has five children, three are married, namely: Maria, Abraham and Agatha, and two: Cornelius and Anna are still at home. I sold my farm in Hoffnungsfeld, where we used to live, and bought land further to the northeast, where we now have two farms.

<p style="margin-left:1in">According to the Reinlander Gemeinde Buch, between 1874 and 1880 almost seven thousand Mennonites immigrated to Manitoba from Ukraine.  Johann and his brother are both listed.  Johann's wife Helena Hiebert and their son David are also listed.  Johann's date of death is taken from the Reinlander Gemeinde Buch.  Johann and his wife arrived in Quebec on 1 July 1875 aboard the S.S. Moravian No. 25, destined for Schanzenfeld West Reserve (Manitoba).  He appears in the 1901 federal census with his wife in Manitoba, sub district of Rhineland, f-4, page 15, entry #122.  They both immigrated in 1875 and naturalization was in 1879.  The census indicates his birth date is 23 October 1839.  I presume he was born in Burwalde because his father appears there in 1847.  He appears in the 1881 census in Manitoba.  His death certificate gives a birth date of 3 October 1834, which I have not used. (The death certificate has some unusual data written on it - the year of birth was changed to 1834 from something undecipherable and the age at death had been written as 76 and then crossed out and changed to 80.) It also gives the date and location of death used herein.  Johann is listed in Burwalde in the 1863 Grain List, and he was not a landowner at that time.<br><br>Information about Johann's children is from the material provided by Rosella Wall. For son Abraham I have a birthdate of 24 March 1862 but this is very close to brother Johann who is shown with a birthdate of 7 November 1861.<br><br>Migration of Mennonites from Ukraine to Canada<br><br>There were three so called waves of migration, occurring in the 1870s, the 1890s and the 1920s. The first and last waves were rather substantial. Economic and political life in Ukraine had been going very well for many decades following the original migration from Danzig in the late 1700s.  The settlement of Chortitza beginning in 1788-1789 continued for a few years, and in 1803 a new colony, Molotschna was established. Both colonies grew and further expansion followed, including the Bergthal colony in the mid 1800s and the Fuerstenland colony a few years later. In total about 10,000 people migrated to Ukraine during the period of colonization. The Mennonite colonists prospered.<br><br>In the latter half of the 19th century the unfettered political and cultural existence of the Mennonites suffered encroachment. Gradually demands for military service or other economic compensation by way of labour or taxes was demanded by the government. Fear of restrictions on education, language and religion also persisted. There was a movement to establish a framework of tolerance for certain restrictions but the more conservative Mennonite groups, such as the Bergthalers, could not support such a policy and the search for an alternative solution began.  In North America a solution was readily at hand because governments were desperately motivated to attract settlers to the expansive west.<br><br>In the 1870s about 17,000 Mennonites made there way to North America. The first new settlers to land in Canada arrived in 1874 and were primarily Bergthalers. In 1875 it was the Choritzers, or people from the "Old Colony", who made the journey to Canada. Many settled in Manitoba. Provincial requirements for English language education subsequently drove the most conservative groups to the area of the Northwest Territories that later became Saskatchewan.<br><br>The second wave numbered about 900 people.  These were Mennonites willing to compromise until the economic and cultural pressures in Ukraine became too great and they finally decided to migrate in the 1890s. Similarly to the earlier Mennonite group, they passed through central Canada to Manitoba and many went on to the Northwest Territories following the promise of land and homesteads.<br><br>In the meantime, in Ukraine, the remaining Mennonites adopted a strategy of increased tolerance and assimilation.  The tactic of accommodation was more than offset by the profound economic benefits they realized in the decades leading to the First World War. Farms grew, villages expanded and the Mennonites became wealthy. Economic expansion proliferated.  Ben Fast describes the farm implement factories, mills, vinegar factories, brewers, weavers and brickyards that operated alongside large farms in the colonies.  Contrary to the fears of earlier Mennonite groups that left Ukraine, those that stayed behind were left to their own language and religion and commercial enterprises. In fact the Mennonites enjoyed a level of cultural and economic prosperity seldom experienced among the broader Ukrainian population. Eventually this good fortune would turn against them.<br><br>World War One was the turning point for the remaining Mennonites.  They had for more than a century possessed an exemption from military service and even though there were mandated compensatory taxes or other services, the general ill will of other citizens was manifest. Further, German speaking populations became targets for governmental policy. People who spoke German were declared enemies of the state. Inevitably the most destructive decree was the forced sale of land assets at absurdly low prices.  This, of course, was disastrous. Before the war ended the Bolshevik Revolution turned the country into a lawless land where survival was grim.  <br><br>Once again the government in Canada facilitated a migration of Mennonites, this time attracting 21,000 people. The Canadian Pacific Railway was a key player in the endeavour, aiming to settle vast areas of the Canadian west.<br><br>Genealogical Events in the Context of the Waves of Migration<br><br>Margaret Schapansky was born in Canada, as was her mother Maria Loewen. Her father, all of her grandparents and several of her great grandparents emigrated from Ukraine in the first wave during the 1870s. It appears that all of these people came from Chortitza Colony.<br><br>Similarly, Helena Striemer was born in Canada, as were her parents. Her grandparents and several of her great grandparents emigrated from Ukraine in the first wave as well. Based on my research thus far all of these people came from Bergthal Colony.<br><br>Albert Fast was born in Canada but his parents came from Ukraine in the 1890s, part of the second wave of migration.  His father, Jacob, and his grandparents, came from Rosenthal, Chortitza Colony. His mother, Helena Epp, and her parents, came from Olgafeld, Fuerstenland Colony, while her grandparents came from Michaelsburg, Fuerstenland Colony.<br><br>Daniel Teichroeb and his father came from Olgafeld, Fuerstenland Colony in the 1920s during the last wave when the strategy of assimilation proved hopeless and remaining in Ukraine was nearly impossible.</p>

The deceased spent his last years in a small house in Rosthern. He lived here quietly and withdrawn and a large goiter from which he suffered for many years made him almost completely unable to do physical work, so that he mostly survived with the help of civic and charitable associations. During this time he wished to be able to leave this world in order to exchange it with another better one.".<br><br>Heinrich's death certificate tells us his father was Johann Fast and his mother was Judith Rempel. The genealogy of these two individuals is well established.<br><br>A passenger list found on ancestry.com has Heinrich listed as a passenger on the S.S. Rhein from Bremen, which docked in Baltimore in October 1904, travelling on his own en route to Gretna, Manitoba and from there to meet his brother Johann in Rosthern, North West Territories. He was a joiner by trade. It is interesting that he is listed immediately after Dietrich Epp in the ship manifest, and his origin is shown as the same town in Ukraine. I wonder if he was travelling with that family. He does not appear to be travelling with any other family members.<br><br>According to family lore, Johann and his family emigrated to Canada in March 1892 and from Spring 1892 until Spring 1893 they wintered in Manitoba with friends. I know they sailed on 17 June 1892 en route to Gretna Manitoba. They no doubt wintered in Manitoba but they were not there until the Summer.  They settled in Rosthern, Saskatchewan in 1893.  By 1897 Johann and his sons had erected log buildings and Johann had filed his homestead claim. The homestead consisted of 160 acres of land three miles north of Waldheim and 13 miles west of Rosthern.  Later he managed a further quarter section for $3 an acre.  He is buried in the Rosthern Cemetery.  His death date is from the grave marker.  He appears with his wife in the 1901 census in Saskatchewan, sub district of Waldheim, page 7, entry #47.<br><br>After a decade of farming he retired to Rosthern. This would mean he was in his mid fifties and able to live without working.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">According to Ben Fast, who had their passports, they emigrated to Canada in 1891.  The book "Waldheim Remembers the Past" quotes family records that say the Epps arrived in Manitoba on 23 April 1891, and stayed with relatives and friends for about a year and a half.  They arrived in Rosthern in 1892 and established their homestead at the current site of Waldheim.  Heinrich is buried in Waldheim, Saskatchewan according to the H. Epp - M. Rempel genealogy.  He appears with his wife in the 1901 census in Saskatchewan, sub district of Waldheim, page 7, entry #53.  I suspect that Heinrich was born in Schoeneberg, although various family records and the Grandma Database records say Fuerstenland.  They emigrated from Fuerstenland to Canada, but his younger siblings are reported as born in Schoeneberg, so this is the location I have used for him. Schoeneberg corresponds with what we know about the family circumstances in 1858 (see notes about Peter Epp).<br><br>According to information I have seen about Heinrich's sister Susanna, she was babtized in Michaelsburg in 1887, when Heinrich was about 32 years of age. Therefore the family must have lived in Michaelsburg when they moved from the Chortitza settlement. It is not clear that Heinrich moved with the family at that point, although Orval Ens says he was raised in Fuerstenland. This does not explain how Heinrich came to marry a woman from Chortitza. Margaretha Remple was born in Neu-Osterwick. There is no evidence the Rempel family was ever in Fuerstenland.<br><br>His son David Epp was a grain buyer. I have seen a reference to a middle name of Martin but this is very unusual for Mennonites at the time. Some of his brothers had a middle initial M which I believe is a reference to his mother's first name. His son Heinrich Epp was a farmer, minister and missionary. <br>His sons Peter Epp and Jacob Epp were farmers. Son Johann was a teacher and a civil servant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">He appears in Bergthaler Gemeinde Buch with his family.  The Bergthaler Gemeinde Buch Quebec Passenger Lists tell us he came to Canada on the S.S. Nova Scotian on 27 July 1874.  He appears in the 1881 Canadian Federal Census in Kronsgart, Manitoba with his wife Helena and his daughters Maria and Helena. He was a farmer there. <br><br>In 1891 and 1901 he was farming in the Reinland area of Manitoba. <br><br>By 1906 the family was living in Vonda in the Humboldt district of Saskatchewan. I have not been able to locate him in 1911 the Census but according to Leonard Doell he moved to the Carrot River area, following Elder Cornelius Epp who took over as Elder of a conservative Bergthaler Mennonite Church there. In 1910 Johann was chosen as a Minister in that church. In 1922 Epp moved to Mexico and I believe the church he founded was disolved. In any case, by the time of the 1921 Census Johann is listed as retired in Laird, Saskatchewan. <br><br>In 1927 Johann joined the regular Bergthal Church as a member but not as a Minister and a year later, on 1 March 1928 he was reinstated as a Minister. He served at the Bergthaler Church in Reinfeld, Saskatchewan.  The church was still there in 1998 when I visited and it still had a functioning outhouse, but no indoor plumbing. He is buried in the Bergthaler Mennonite Church Cemetery near the Hague Ferry at Reinfeld.  In 2022 the church was gone and replaced with a new building. The grave markers were mostly removed as well and ugly steel markers embedded in concrete replaced them.<br><br>The 1916 census indicates that Heinrich, Gerhard and Anna were all living with the parents at that time. There is also a 2 year old child named William listed as a son. This is more likely to be a child belonging to Wilhelm Striemer and Anna Dyck.<br><br>I have seen Johann's son Gerhard listed as George Gerhard.

She really did attain the age of 106.<br><br>Johann and the Saskatchewan Bergthaler Church<br><br>Much of this information originates with Leonard Doell who provided great assistance in my research of Johann Striemer. <br><br>Johann had been a member of the Saskatchewan Bergthaler Church, probably from the time he first moved to Saskatchewan. In 1908 Cornelius Epp, an Elder in the Bergthaler Church since 1902, left the church and established his own church, known as the Epp Mennonite Church. A small group of congregants left the Bergthaler Church to join Epp, among them Johann. Around 1910 Johann was elected as a minister in Epp's church. <br><br>In 1922 Epp emigrated to Mexico but Johann remained in Saskatchewan and continued to fulfil his obligations as a minister of the church to which he belonged. A larger group of congregants emigrated to Paraguay in 1926 and in 1927 Johann rejoined the Saskatchewan Bergthaler Church. On 1 March 1928 he was chosen as a minister of this church.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">She appears in the Bergthaler Gemeinde Buch with her parents. The Striemer - Giesbrecht Genealogy tells us she was Johann Striemer's wife.  She appears in the 1881 Canadian Federal Census in Kronsgart.  The Grandma Database says she arrived in Canada in 1875. Her mother arrived a year later. It appears that Helena travelled with two younger siblings. She is buried in the Bergthaler Mennonite Church Cemetery near the Hague Ferry at Reinfeld.  Note that the birth date here is from the grave marker.<br><br>There are two versions of the 13 July 1875 SS Peruvian passenger list. One is in excel format and shows Helena with sister Margaretha (Gretchen) and brother Jacob. The other list shows these three with a Maria Kauenhowen, who is on the excel list as Maria Giesbrecht. Maria was 52 years of age. Maria was the aunt of the three younger people.<br><br>Maria Giesbrecht was a widow. I suspect that her brother, Johann, chose to send his three elder children to Canada with her while he sold his farm and made the arrangements to get the rest of the family to Canada.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Johann Dyck and Katharina Peters settled in Reinland Manitoba. Johann appears with the family in the 1901 census.  He came to Canada in 1874.  The census assumes his wife did too, but we know she came later with her family and therefore they must have been married in Canada before 1891.  In the census they are found in the District of Lisgar, sub district Rhineland #56, F-11 page 8 line 38. The enumeration was on 17 April 1901.  Note that the 1901 census data from Family Search gives a birth year of 1845 while the Bergthal Gemeinde Buch and the Grandma Database gives 1846.  The census data may contain a transcription error. <br><br>The 1906 Census tells us that Johann and Katharina and their family were living in the Humboldt area of Saskatchewan by 1906. Daughter Anna is listed there.<br><br>Most of his children are listed in the Sommerfeld Gemeinde Buch but the last two are listed in the Saskatchewan Bergthaler Church Book. <br><br>His son Abraham may have died in 1954. This is the date provided in the Grandma Database. SOn Heinrich may have died in 1963. Daughter Elizabeth may have died in 1953. Son Kornelius may have died in 1965.<br><br>I have seen references to a middle initial of E.  Whether this is factual and what it stands for are unknowns. Possibly it represents his mother's first name.</p>
