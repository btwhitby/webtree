<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Matthies was a Lutheran who married a Mennonite woman named Catharina Jantzen in a Lutheran ceremony. Their children were baptized as Lutherans. The family moved to Lithuania around 1714. Glenn Penner says that by 1722 their six children had been baptized as Mennonites. In 1724 the family was expelled from Lithuanian and headed back to the Elbing area. While the Grandma Database indicates Matthias may have died around 1724 the records published by Erwin Wittenberg and Manuel Janz show that he returned to the Elbing region around 1724-1726. There they joined the Frisian congregation at Thiensdorf. Grandson David was born there sometime around 1731. Horst Penner believes that David is the ancestor of all the Mennonite Schapanskys that migrated to the Ukraine under Catherine the Great.<br><br>In his article "Joining and Leaving the Mennonite Community: A Genealogical Perspective; Part 5: Mennonites from Prussian Lithuania in Russia", published in Roots and Branches June 2022, Glenn Penner refers to a report written in 1722 to record the investigation of Matthies Schapansky's request to join the Mennonite Church. Glenn gave me a copy of the transcription: <br><br>"Matthys Schepanski ein Eigenthumer von Bogdahnen, aus Elbing aus der Vorstadt geburtig, von Lutherischen Eltern gebohren auch seines Wissens nicht anders als Lutherisch getaufft, 52 Jahr &lt;*1670>, sagt pravia admonitione de veritate dicenda, dass er fur 8 Jahre &lt;1714> anhero gekommen; so lang er im Lande, sey er uber 2 mahl nicht in der Kirche auch niemahlen zum Abendmahl gewesen. Vorhin aber sey er in Elbing in der Bergischen Kirche vor der Stadt offt gegangen, und zwar das Jahr zweymahl, biss jetzo sey er noch kein Mennoniste, habe aber so lang er im Lande, schon die Gedanken gehabt, zur Mennonistischen Lehre zu treten, doch wolle er sich zuvor woll pruffen. Gefragt: wo seine Kinder. Rt. Er habe 6 Kinder, die alle Mennonistisch, weil  ihre Mutter desselben Glaubens. Zwey hatten schon geheyratet, ein Sohn wohne in Jedwolaiten, die Tochter aber auff Bogdahnen habe den Mennonisten Hans Schmidt. Dimissus."<br><br>Roughly translated this says "Matthys Schepanski, a land owner from Bogdahnen, a native of Elbing in the suburbs, born of Lutheran parents and, as far as he knows, baptized as Lutheran 52 years ago (therefore born in 1670), says he arrived here 8 years ago (in 1714). As long as he was in the country, he had not been to church more than twice and never had communion. But previously he had gone to the Bergische Kirche in front of the city in Elbing, twice a year. He was not yet a Mennonist, but he had already had the idea of becoming a Mennonist for as long as he had been in the country. He has 6 children, all of whom are Mennonite because their mother is of the same faith. Two have already married: one son lives in Jedwolaiten, his daughter lives in Bogdahnen, married to the Mennonist Hans Schmidt. Dimissed."<br><br>The investigation must have taken place in Lithuania and he must have moved there in 1714.<br><br>The connection between Gottfried and Matthies is established by genealogical records. He was also born in Thiensdorf. It is not certain that Godfried is the father of David (1731) but the circumstances point to this. The Thiensdorf Nachfahrenliste recounts the story of a "son of Sczepanski" who had lived in Lithuania and then moved to Elbing where he lived around 1730 and had a son in 1731 in Thiensdorf named David. This fits the known information about Gottfried.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">There must be at least one generation between Gijsbert (1640) and Benjamin (1733). While the hypothesis has often been that this individual is Benjamin (abt 1690) there is no evidence that he is a son of Gijsbert (1640) or the father of Benjamin (1733).<br><br> are a few notes about Benjamin (approx.. 1790) and his wives and in-laws.<br>Benjamin (1790): <br>He was a haberdasher who lived in Schidlitz and Stolzenberg, near Danzig.  The marriage dates are taken from the Danzig Church Book.  James Fehr says he was a goldsmith. His year of birth is often given as 1696, corresponding to an age of 20 when he was married the first time. He must have been born a bit later than this, under the hypothesis he is the son of Gijsbert De Veer (1640-1693).<br>His first wife, Barbara Momber, was considerably older than he was. There are various genealogies giving her birth date as 24 June 1663, but this is before her parents were married. This seems to be of doubtful accuracy given that her parents were Mennonites.  I have assumed that she was born after they were married and estimated her age accordingly. She was part of the wealthy De Momber family and there is speculation that the marriage was arranged for commercial purposes and to affect a transfer of wealth. Whatever the case, Barbara died within ten years and Benjamin remarried. He had no children with his first wife.<br>Elizabeth Wiens, his second wife, was the mother of his children. His daughter Elizabeth is mentioned in the Danzig Church Book Baptisms record. His son Benjamin is not mentioned in any Danzig church records. The connection between them is documented by Hermann Thiessen and there are no source references available. Odette Fransen also shows this relationship but in a conversation I had with her she indicated this is speculative. The Grandma Database says the date of birth is 2 July 1709.  Considering her baptism was in 1724 this is possible but rather young. The Danzig Church Book Baptism records link her to her father Gert Wiens. She may have been living in the village of Stolzenberg in the Danzig area at the time of her death, based on unsubstantiated information I saw online.<br>Parents of Elizabeth Wiens:<br>Gerhard Wiens (1690-1738). His  death date is taken from the Danzig Church Book, in which he is listed as Gert Wiens.  Neither his marriage nor his baptism is listed in the Danzig Church Book.  The baptism of his daughter Elisabeth is in the Danzig Church Book, and he is named there. The surname originates in the Friesland area of the Netherlands.<br><br>Susanna Loewen (1690-1741). In the Danzig Church Book her name is spelled Sanke Leuens. The death date is taken from this source. She is listed as the wife of 'oude Gerdt Wiensche'. Her baptism is not listed in the Danzig Church Book.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">The baptism record of his son Jacob in 1761 proves the marriage to Christina. This was an infant baptism. Glenn Penner says that Jacob and Christina belonged to the Frisian Mennonite Church. The other children of Jacob and Christina do not appear in the Lutheran baptism records, although their daughter Katharina was admitted into the Danzig Mennonite Church (Flemish) on 26 November 1787, prior to her wedding in December, without baptism. This leads to all sorts of speculation about the family circumstances. There is a possibility that Christina might have been a Lutheran from Finland. There are various uncited Internet references to Jacob dying in 1761. One hypothesis is that Christina was baptized a Mennonite in order to marry Jacob but on his death she reverted to Lutheranism and had son Jacob baptized in the Lutheran Church.<br><br>Various references in myheritage.com specify Jacob's birth date as 17 July 1724.<br><br>Jacob's son Jacob later was baptized in the Flemish Church, became a minister in Neuenhuben and was based in Wotzlaff. The Grandma Database has an entry saying he died in 1808 but this is incorrect. It was his wife who died in 1808. It is unclear if he was born in Heubuden or baptized in the Mennonite Church there.

<p style="margin-left:1in">Michael Fehr has his family tree information on FamilyTreeDNA and he is an ancestor of Jacob Bartsch.  In his tree he has identified the parents of Christina Philipsen.  I have not been able to find hard evidence of this association. It requires further research. If Michael is correct then her father is an Erich Philipsen and her mother is an Brijtha Jacobsdr Alfvare. However, this data is from Finnish and Swedish records that may not related to the Christina Philipsen in the Danzig Church records.<br><br>Jacob and Christina had their son Jacob baptized in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Peter and Paul in Danzig on 21 February 1761. This gives us certainty about Christina's name. I do not understand the practise of Mennonites christening infants. I thought they did not do this. However, the Finnish record for Christina indicates she was baptized as an infant. Finland was primarily Lutheran in the 1700s. If this is the same Christina then possibly she was a Lutheran who converted to the Mennonite Church (perhaps when she married Bartsch) and had one of her sons christened in the Lutheran Church in Danzig. Glenn Penner notes that none of the other children appear in the baptism record. I think that what happened was that her husband Jacob died in 1761, in accordance with family trees on the web, before their son Jacob was born and Christina reverted to Lutheranism and had her new son christened in the absence of her husband. This is speculative because I have found no sources for either the birth or death dates of husband Jacob. The uncited Internet dates for Jacob say he was born 17 July 1724 and died 1761.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online (GAMEO) has an entry for Peter Epp that lists his parents Peter Epp (1681-1733) and Anna Claassen (1683-1730) and confirms the birth of Peter in Petershagen on 23 January 1725. Peter married Catharina Wiens in 1751 in Nassenhuben, Prussia, the place of her birth. She was the daughter of Thomas Wiens and Anna Hildebrandt. Peter and Catharina had eleven children.<br><br>According to GAMEO Peter was a farmer in Neuenhuben near Danzig. He was chosen as a deacon on 3 April 1757, as a minister on 5 February 1758, and as an elder on 26 September 1779. GAMEO tells us "He went through the difficult period of the transfer of West Prussia from Polish to Prussian sovereignty, when the Danzig congregation was for a while divided between the two realms. In this period the immigration to Russia also began, in which Epp took an active part. He died in the midst of preparations for a trip to South Russia in 1789."<br><br>Peter is listed with three sons and three daughters in the 1776 census in Neuenhuben. His wife predeceased him earlier in 1776. The census count matches the number of people that should be in the household at the time of the census.<br><br>His son, Peter Epp, was one of the original group of 228 settlers in Chortitza in the 1789-1790 wave of immigrants. He appears in Rosenthal on the list of first settlers published by Glenn Penner as well as the 1789 settler list published by Peter Rempel. Unruh provides certainty that Peter and the family were in Chortitza as early as 1795, telling us Peter became a minister there in 1796.  The Danzig Family Book Volume 2 says that Peter and his family went to Ukraine in 1795 but this must be incorrect. The 1808 Chortitza census says his son Peter arrived in Chortitza Colony in 1789. This corresponds with the family moving in 1789. The citizenship certificate issued to David Epp and included in the Epp-Ens genealogy publication specifies that his great grandfather, who in this context is the son Peter, arrived in Ukraine in 1789.<br><br>Daughter Maria Epp's birth and baptism dates are from the Danzig Church Book. The Grandma Database gives a date of death. It falls a few days after the 1806 Molotschna Census was taken. Her husband had remarried before the 1811 Molotschna Census, thereby confirming she had died between the two census events.<br><br>Peter Epp's brother Heinrich married a Maria Wiens who was born in 1742. Maria's father was Thomas Wiens. Her mother was Maria. The coincidence, if it is a coincidence, is that Peter's wife Catharina Wiens, born in 1730, also had a father named Thomas Wiens. I suspect this is the same man. His wife when Catharina was born was Anna Hildebrandt. Likely she died and Thomas remarried. The Danzig Church Book does not provide any clues to substantiate this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">According to Henry Schapansky, Cornelius was from Gross Plenendorf, Danzig Gemeinde.  However, in the Danzig Church book listing his daughter's marriage to Gerhard Penner he is shown as coming from Nieundorp. In the Danzig Church book listing deaths there is a Cornelius Woelke from Nieundorp who died in 1756.  I believe this is the same person who is listed in the marriage records. I don't think this is the same person who Henry Schapansky refers to; that person is referred to distinctly as originating in Plenendorf, as shown in the death record of his wife.

Once again, in her death record she is shown as the widow of Cornelius Woelke of Nieundorp. The Cornelius who Schapansky refers to and who is listed in the Grandma Database married a Liescke Thielmann.

<p style="margin-left:1in">He is mentioned in the Danzig Church Book in connection with his daughter's baptism in 1764. The Danzig Church book lists the death of a Hans Entz In 1780. Presumably this is the same man. <br><br>I have seen an internet reference indicating his wife's first name was Susanna. However there is no source reference data available. There is a Geneanet family tree showing a wife named Susanna Jacobsen, and she has a well defined ancestry in the Danzig Church Books. However, the death record states clearly that she died in 1794 at the age of 73 and had never been married. Therefore this is an erroneous lead.<br><br>There is a Cornelius Entz mentioned in the Danzig Church Book in 1758 associated with his daughter's baptism (she was Anna). It is interesting to speculate on the relationship of Hans and Cornelius.</p>
