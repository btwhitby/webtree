<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">I have seen this named written as von Bargen. Names such as this (using 'De', 'Von' and 'Van') generally originated in the Southern and Spanish Netherlands according to H. Schapansky.  His son Heinrich was born in Leske, Gross Werder, between 1745 and 1748.  Therefore Heinrich, the father, was born around 1728 or earlier. There is a Heinrich listed in the 1776 Census with an annotation indicating this is the son. There is a Heinrich listed in the both the 1772 and the 1789 Census in Leske.  It isn't clear whether these refer to the father or the son but it might be that the 1772 census refers to the father and the 1789 census to the son. The Heinrich in the 1789 census is listed as a leaseholder.<br><br>I found information about his son Jacob and I quote it here. I do not have a source reference for this material. <br><br>"He was a member of the Heubuden Gemeinde and later became a member of the Orlofferfeld Gemeinde.  He applied for immigration to Russia on 11 Nov 1803 but did not leave until the summer of 1805.  He migrated from Neuteichsdorf, Prussia to South Russia in 1805 with his second wife and children (P. Rempel, p. 96; B. H. Unruh, p. 347).  While B. H. Unruh, p. 347 states that he immigrated to the Molotschna Colony, it appears that he never actually went there and instead settled immediately in Kronsgarten. In the 1806 Chortitza Colony Census he is listed in Kronsgarten (P. Rempel, p. 19). In the 1816 Census his family is listed at Kronsgarten #12 but he is stated to have died in 1812 (Stumpp's book The Emigration from Germany to Russia, p. 873).  The ages of his family members as given in that census are as of about 1812.  His age is given as 64 in his 1805 emigration records suggesting that he may have been born ca 1741 (P. Rempel, p. 96). According to the Orlofferfelde church records he transferred from the Heubuden (Flemish) to the Orlofferfelde (Frisian) church in 1783. This was due to his marriage to Catharina Spenst, who was a member of the Orlofferfelde church.<br><br>According to the 1772 census of West Prussia he was a farmer living in Leske with his wife and one son under the age of 12. He owned 2.5 Morgen of land at the time. According to the 1776 census of Mennonites in West Prussia he was living in Leske with his wife, one son and 2 daughters. According to the 1789 census of Mennonite landowners in West Prussia he was living in Leske and possessed 3.5 Morgen of land as an Erbpachter (hereditary lease).<br><br>According to an inheritance document dated 8 Aug 1805 found in the Berlin archives (Berlin Archives I Ha Rep7 file B4177) when Jacob Bergen (#18813) applied to leave for Russia on 11 Nov 1803 the estate of his first wife had not been settled and inheritance was due to those children who went to Russia with their father. The administrators of the estate are listed as Wilhelm Bergen of NeuMuensterberg (#659965) and Johann Bergen of Tiegerweide (#17323). Arrangements were made for the money to be taken to Russia by Heinrich Bergen (#43827) and given to the guardians of the minor children, Jacob Braun (#53146) and Hermann Dyck (#18811). There is good reason to believe that these 4 Bergen men were brothers. If not, it is very likely that they were closely related. Jacob's father is known from the 1835 Molotschna colony census to be Heinrich.  Heinrich apparently didn't leave for Russia until the summer of 1805."</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">His parents were Matthias Schapansky and Catharina Jantzen according to records published by Erwin Wittenberg and Manuel Janz. He is listed as a landowner in the village of Jedwilleiten in Lithuanian between 1720 and 1722. He farmed the land there jointly with Gerhardt Eckert. Wittenberg and Janz published a map that shows where the farm was. Gottfried was part of the expelled group of Mennonites. He moved to the Elbing region around 1724-1726. Later in 1741 he lived in the Friedrichsgraben area. This move was in response to a program by the Prussian crown to attract Mennonites to the Memel lowlands to reclaim the swampy land and boost the economy. The project was doomed to failure because of extensive flood damage to the land prior to the resettlement. I believe the settlement was eventually abandoned. By 1749 Gottfried had left (Wittenberg and Janz published a list of settlers remaining in 1749 and Gottfried was not on the list.)<br><br>I speculate that Gottfried is the father of David Schapansky (1731) based on the research completed by Alfons Sczepanski as outlined below. <br><br>Synopsis: Alfons Sczepanski Thiensdorf Nachfahrenliste<br><br>A Sczepanski son born in the 1690s lived in Lithuania for a period of time before relocating sometime before 1730 to Thiensdorf to farm there. His wife is unknown, but he had a son named David, born around 1731 in the Thiensdorf area. [This corresponds to Gottfried Schapansky who was born in Thiensdorf in 1696, farmed in the Memel lowlands after the settlement was established in 1714, was expelled in 1724, and headed back to the Elbing area. Thiensdorf is south of Elbing and east of Marienburg.]<br><br>David Schapansky married Anna Pauls (born 1736). The marriage produced two children. Herman was born around 1754. Cornelius was born in 1765. [Henry Schapansky has written that there was also a son, David, born in 1751. It seems likely that David was a son of the elder David. Wes Reimer has written that there was a daughter, Anna. There is no information to support this assertion.]<br><br>Cornelius was born in Hohenwalde. He was baptized in 1781 in the Thiensdorf church [this is also recorded in the church records where he is listed as the surviving son of David]. He was married to Maria Phillipsen (born 1782 in Campenau) in 1800. They had one son, Cornelius, born in 1802. The son and his offspring never left Prussia. Maria died of "childbed fever" in 1803. Cornelius did not remarry. He died in Campenau in 1831.<br><br>Herman was born in Thiensdorf. He farmed in Kerbshorst and was also a carpenter according to an 1811 reference [this was probably the 1811 Elbing census]. Herman died in Schwansdorf in 1824 at the age of 70. He was married twice. His first wife was Maria Klassen, born in 1764, whom he married in March 1785. Maria died of typhus in 1800 at the age of 36. This marriage produced three sons: Herman (1785); Heinrich (1792); and Johann (1794). His second wife was Anna Heinrichs, born in Kerbshorst in 1781. They were married in 1800. She died in Ellerwald in 1857. This marriage produced eleven children:  Cornelius (1801); Anna (1804); Cornelius (1806); another daughter who died as in infant (1809); Heinrich (1811); Maria (1812); Anna (1816); Cornelia (1817); Johann (1819); David (1821); and Catharina (1824).<br><br>Herman (1785) was baptised in the Markushof church in 1802 and lived in Kerbshorst. Heinrich (1792) died of typhus in 1801. Johann (1794) died of whooping cough in 1794. Cornelius (1801) died as in infant in 1801. Anna (1804) died in 1807 of "lazy fiber". Cornelius (1806) died in Ellerwald in 1861 at the age of 55. Heinrich (1811) and his offspring remained in Prussia. Maria (1812) died of typhus in 1825 at the age of 13. Anna (1816) married and had children (all unknown) and she and her offspring appear to have remained in Prussia. Cornelia (1817) died young. Johann (1819) died young. David (1821) died at the age of 10 in 1831. Catharina (1824) died in 1825 of typhus.<br><br> [Herman (1785) migrated to Chortitza in 1818. Henry Schapansky writes that the family were Lithuanian Mennonites, but it is clear that the family lived in the Thiensdorf-Markushof congregational area during the latter half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The confusion may stem from the repeated relocations of Gottfried. He moved to Lithuania, then returned to Elbing. Later he went back to Lithuania in 1741 for a few years, before the Friedrichsgraben settlement was abandoned. It seems that the family returned to the Thiensdorf area around 1750.]</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He was a Flemish Mennonite.  <br><br>Different sources give a range of dates for his year of birth.  Relying on the Chortitza census data available in Unruh it is quite clear that he was born around 1733.  The 1808 census was taken on 20 September and he was 75; the 1814 census was taken on 4 October and he was 81; therefore he must have been born after 4 October 1732 and before 20 September 1733.  Genealogy work by Verna Fehr provides his year of death. I can't substantiate this.<br><br>The often cited relationship of Benjamin to parents Benjamin and Elizabeth is hypothetical, based on speculation by Herman Thiessen. There are no genealogical records to substantiate this. Benjamin would have been about eight years old when his mother died and ten when his father died. Since his father didn't remarry either of these events would normally result in Benjamin being placed with another family. It is apparent that he didn't live in the Danzig area when he was baptized or married because there is no trace of him in the Danzig Church Book. However, he also does not appear in the 1776 Census and this indicates he was in Danzig, outside the census zone at that time (although I understand that this census is known to be less than comprehensive so no concrete conclusion can be made). In 1785 he appears in the 1782-1795 Baptism Record for the Rosenort Gemeinde, living in Klein Mausdorf; his children Anna and Isaac were baptized in that year.<br><br>He was residing in Neuendorf in the Chortitza Colony as early as 1793 and remained there until Nieder-Chortitza was established in 1803, and he appears in the census there in 1803.  By 1808 he had moved back to Neuendorf to live with his son Jacob and later he moved with his son to Neu-Osterwick.  Stump lists his son Jacob in Neuenberg in 1795, coming from Krebsfelde but Benjamin is not listed.  Peter Rempel lists a Benjamin Defehr who arrived in Chortitza in 1789 and settled in Nieder-Chortitza. Glenn Penner's work on the first settlers in Chortitza indicates he actually settled in Neuendorf in 1789.<br><br>Unruh also published census data saying his son Jacob came from Krebsfelde. Klein Mausdorf and Krebsfelde are adjacent villages. In his Rosenthal article H. Schapansky says he may have lived in Nehrung or Scharpau in 1776. Scharpau (district of Marienburg) is a village adjacent to the Nehrung area (district of Danzig).  Schapansky also finds him in Klein Mausdorf, Marienburg at some point around the time of the 1776 census.   <br><br>His son Isaak is listed in the 1814 census in Nieder-Chortitza with his family. He is likely the same as Isaac de Veer who exchanged his house in Rosenthal with Johann Schellenberg of Chortitza.<br><br>The Grandma Database has additional information stating that he was a watch maker in an 1801 census and a teacher in the village of Ruckenau in Prussia. He does appear in the 1772 Prussian Census, living in Ruckenau. His occupation is given as School Master. This census indicates a wife, two sons and two daughters. These children would be Isaak, Anna, Heinrich, and Helena. People living in Ruckenau, Klein Mausdorf and Krebsfelde all were members of the Rosenort Gemeinde.<br><br>The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online (GAMEO) has a detailed entry explaining the De Veer lineage. The first ancestor listed is Gysbert Jansz de Veer, born 14 May 1556, at Schiedam, South Holland. One of his sons, Gysbert de Veer (born in Amsterdam in 1600 and died in Danzig in 1646) was married first to Anna van Buygen (Bergen), then to Maria van Dijck. Gysbert and Maria's son Gysbert (born in 1640 and died in 1693) is the ancestor of the Mennonite branch in Prussia. Based on the information available Benjamin De Veer (born 1733) is the grandson of this Gysbert. However, there exists an hypothesis that Gysbert (1640-1693) had a son named Cornelius who is Benjamin's grandfather. I am aware of no evidence this Cornelius existed. <br><br>Based on a comprehensive review of the Mennonite migration information available it appears that in addition to Benjamin and his children there were two sons of Cornelius de Veer (Johann and Cornelius) who also moved to Ukraine. Cornelius was probably younger than Benjamin.<br><br>In notes related to Jan de Veere I discuss the DNA evidence that links the family back to the early 1500s.<br><br>The parents of Benjamin are going to be found in the Marienburg Region (Gross Werder). Here are the salient geographic facts:<br><br>1. Horst Penner has placed Philipp van Dijck in Gross Werder in 1592;<br>2. Ulrich Dyck has placed Maria Grauwert in Gross Werder at her birth in 1568;<br>3. Logically their daughter Maria (1606) was born in Gross Werder;<br>4. Gybert de Veer (1600), who was located in Amsterdam and Danzig might have also been in the Gross Werder area, although this is speculation. However:<br>5. Arlene Kauwenhoven has place son Philipp (1629) in Gross Werder (Klein Mausdorf specifically) and it is reported that he was a broker there;<br>6. Calmeyer states that son Gysbert (1640) lived in Gross Werder;<br>7. Stumpp and Unruh place Cornelius de Veer's (1749) sons in Gross Werder (Czattkau);<br>8. The 1776 Census places Cornelius de Veer (1749) in Gross Werder (Neumuensterberg);<br>9. The 1772 Census places Benjamin in Gross Werder (Ruckenau);<br>10. The Rosenort Baptism records place Benjamin in Gross Werder (Klein Mausdorf) after 1782;<br>11. Unruh places Benjamin's son Jacob in Gross Werder (Krebsfeld) before migrating to Chortitza.<br><br>Cornelius (1749) and Benjamin (1733) may have been brothers, cousins or second cousins.  Calmeyer asserts that Gysbert was the patriarch of the Russian de Veer branches and consequently Cornelius and Benjamin must be his descendants. Records for children of Gysbert born in Gross Werder may not have been maintained at the Danzig Flemish Church, leading to the current gap in information. There are one or two generations of male descendants unaccounted for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">H. Schapansky believes Anna and Benjamin were married in 1761.  The Grandma Database gives her year of birth as 1736.  Schapansky uses 1740.  According to Hermann Thiessen her maiden name was Waberstein.  This is based on a chart in Folder 411 among his papers.  There is confusion about Helena Bergen and Anna Waberstein (for example, her maiden name was reportedly either Waberstein or Bergen per Hannah Rempel's 30 June 1989 letter to Tim Janzen) and some researchers feel there was only one woman, named Anna Bergen.  Ruth Friesen believes her name was Waberstein or Haberstein, in accordance with Bud Veer.  Conrad Stoesz confirms the name to be Waberstein, as does James Fehr.  Other sources on the Internet give more weight to Haberstein on the basis that Bud Veer has apparently done extensive research on this and purportedly leans that way. Note in the 1727 Brandregister land census there is a mention of a Hans Habenstein in Einlage, an Isaac Habenstein in Klein Mausdorf, and an Abraham Habenstein in Krebsfelde, all adjacent villages in the area of the Rosenort Gemeinde. Therefore Haberstein could be correct.  On the other hand, none of the von Bergens and von Bargens in that census lived in the area of the Rosenort Gemeinde. Based on these facts and in the absence of other good sources, I am taking Habenstein as the most correct name.<br><br>One interesting observation is that Isaac Habenstein lived in Klein Mausdorf, the location associated with Benjamin de Veer. I sense that if records were to emerge they would point to a connection between Isaac Habenstein and the wife of de Veer.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Johann Bartsch was one of the deputies, along with Jacob Hoeppner, appointed to assess colonization opportunities offered in the Ukraine during the reign of Catherine the Great. The pair went on their investigative mission in 1786 and toured the land along the Dnieper River, choosing an area of richly fertile land near the town of Berislav. Agreements were signed and upon their return to Danzig arrangements were made for settlers to begin their journeys to the so called New Russia.  <br><br>Grigory Potemkin was the governor of New Russia and he held vast lands encompassing the entire Chortitza Colony region.  When the settlers arrived they were astounded to learn that their agreement was broken and they would be granted land in Chortitza. The Chortitza area, north of Berislav, was more deeply wooded, less easy to clear, and further from a substantial trading port to move agricultural produce.  It was hardly ideal but there were no options.  <br><br>It seems clear that Potemkin had in mind the settlement of his own land from the beginning. He died unexpectedly in 1791 and knowledge of his ulterior motives are lost with him. It is relevant to note that the Russian Empire at the time was still a feudal economy, and much more absolutely feudal than the English system of medieval times.  Peasants in Ukraine were hardly more than slaves, indentured servants at best, and could be bought and sold with the land they worked. Whether Potemkin had in mind this model when he invited the Mennonite settlers is unknown. Fortunately his death meant that the Mennonites could operate the typical democratic, capitalistic colony they preferred.<br><br>Johann Bartsch was a Frisian Mennonite at the time of his deputation.  He later joined the Flemish congregation. He was an original settler in Chortitza in 1789 and remained one of the leaders of the colony for much of its early existence. There is a marble monument dedicated to Johann in Steinbach, Manitoba, that originally was located in Rosenthal, Chortitza.<br><br>Johann's first wife was Susanna Lammerts. She died in 1790 and Johann married her sister Magdalena.  H. Schapansky indicates a different second wife, Helena Klassen, but the census information published by Unruh is clear that the second wife was Magdalena.  That said, some census information gives her name as Helena, an alternate form used for Magdalena. But the dates of birth and death cited in Schapansky agree with the dates for Magdalena Lammerts. Johann was in Rosenthal from 1789 through at least 1814.<br><br>He had a son but there is no information about him except that he existed.  He is referenced in two letters Johann wrote to Susanna during his trip to Ukraine.  I have read the letters and two quotations stand out. In the first letter he writes: "Do not forget what I mentioned to you regarding my only little son, shortly before our departure." In the second letter he writes: "Keep in mind that the good you do to the smallest (one) I regard as something done to me personally." I find these statements puzzling. It seems that he feels beholden to Susanna for taking care of the boy, whom he singles out in both letters.  I wonder if the implication is that his son was born to a different woman and Johann was forced to disclose this to his wife because of his trip to Ukraine.<br><br>Whatever the situation was with this young son, the records for the migration in 1789 tell us that Johann and his wife arrived with four adults and three children in their family unit. The three children must be their daughters Susanna, Maria and Sara. Their son did not live to reach the new settlement. It is unclear who the other two adults were. The next census, in 1795, shows his family with his new wife, Helena, and two new daughters. The Rempel information tells us the family unit was comprised of one man, three women and three female children. There is a vital statistics recored for Rosenthal showing that a Johann Bartsch had a son who died in 1801. This is likely to be Johann whose mother was Magdalena.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Isbrand died between January and April 1803 in Einlage. His death at the age of 66 is listed in the Chortitza Vital Records. H. Schapansky believes he lived in Konigsberg for some time but that he might also have lived in the Danzig area and the Marienburg area. This seems to be all over the map, so to speak. Schapansky says his son Wilhelm was born in Konigsberg. I do not have a source reference for this but it might explain the absence of other records (he does not seem to be in either the 1772 or the 1776 census). Unruh's Immigration List says he came from Stobbendorf. His son Wilhelm also is listed there and also came from Stobbendorf. Wilhelm also has a record in Unruh indicating he was from Konigsberg. I suspect the difference between the locations has to do with where the individual was born and where they lived before immigrating. If this is the case then the origin is Konigsberg but the family moved to Stobbendorf in the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde. There are entries in the Tiegenhagen records for the baptisms of Dietrich and Katherina, both of whom lived in Stobbendorf. <br><br>Isbrand was an original settler in the first group of 228 households to establish themselves in Eastern Ukraine. Sons Wilhelm and Dietrich accompanied him. Although I have not researched this I think some of his other children also were with the family.<br><br>In the 1795 census for Chortitza (Einlage #29) his first wife, Anna, is listed. In 1801 his second wife, Katharina, is listed. H. Schapansky indicates that there might have been a wife before Anna but there is no information about her. Isbrand's sister Agatha was living with him and his family in that census.<br><br>There is a possibility that his parents were Gerhard Rempel (1705) and Dorothea Schule (1709), based on old Grandma Database information that has been removed as of 2024 because records are lacking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Heinrich Wiebe was among the first householders to settle in Chortitza, listed among the original 228 settler families. He appears in the 1776 Prussian Census at Altendorf in the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde. H. Schapansky also says that he might have lived at Stobbendorf and Pietzkendorf.<br><br>Unruh lists him in the 1808 census for Rosenthal. Here it says Heinrich Wiebe emigrated from Pietzkendorf in the Marienburg Region. His son, Heinrich, and his family is living with them. He had a large farm for that time: seven horses; fifteen cows; nine pigs; and two sheep. In the 1788 Chortitza immigrant list found in Unruh's book it says he came from Stobbendorf. I think he emigrated from Stobbendorf and was born in Pietzkendorf. This rationale is consistent with my comments about Dietrich Rempel.<br><br>In the 1811 census he is at Rosenthal #17 and working as a tailor.

<p style="margin-left:1in">I wonder if she might be related to Wilhelm Baerg who purportedly lived in Lackendorf at the same time as Anna's husband David Redekop. Anna and Wilhelm could conceivably have been siblings. The Grandma database gives a year of death of 1757 but also says she may have moved to Chortitza in the 1790s. There is no trace of her in early census records for Chortitza. She may have had a daughter, Justina, born in 1758, which would contradict the 1757 date. The 1776 Census indicates David had a wife at the time of the census. Whether this is Anna or a second wife is impossible to know from the data available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Heinrich lived in Haberhorst at the time of the 1776 Prussian census. He was part of the Tiegenhagen Flemish Gemeinde (later he joined the Orlofferfelde Frisian Gemeinde), and had one son counted in the 1776 census. Other information provided by H. Schapansky indicates that there may have been other sons and they may have been living with another family in 1776. <br><br>There is a Heinrich Wieler from Tiegenhof married to an Elisabeth Berends (#17327) listed in the Danzig Family Book. According to that information they would have been in Petershagen in 1761 when a daughter, Margaretha, was born.  They would have been members of the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde. However, the Danzig Church Book does not mention son Nicholas, and this is a concern. However, if the family lived in a different Gemeinde, and particularly if they left the Flemish congregation to join the Frisian congregation, perhaps the recorded information was fragmentary.<br>   <br>There are two Heinrich Wiehlers in the Grandma Database that could refer to the same individual (#17326 and #266168). We know that Heinrich was in Haberhorst at the time of the 1776 census. This village was within the Tiegenhagen Flemish Gemeinde. The other Heinrich was in Tiegenhof at some point in his life according to the Grandma Database. Tiegenhof residents would have belonged to the Tiegenhagen Flemish Gemeinde. Furthermore, Haberhorst is only 25 km north and 14 km east of the village of Tiegenhof.  This geographic concurrence and the Gemeinde match support the hypothesis they are the same person and in turn support the possibility Elisabeth is the correct spouse.<br><br>There is a possibility that he had a brother Bernhard, as explained more fully in the notes for Heinrich's son Nicholas. Bernhard appeared in the 1776 Prussian census in Spitalskampe.<br><br>I have standardized the spelling of his surname, which I have seen in some records spelled "Wiehler".</p>

I have researched the Gelderland Archives quite thoroughly and mapped out much of her ancestry but I have not discovered her relationship to Heinrich Wiehler.  She was the child of Berent Franzen Lassere and Anna Cleeve. Berent was the son of Frans Berentsen and Marijke Jansz Berentsen; Marijke was the daughter of Jan Berentsen and Stijneke Jans.

<p style="margin-left:1in">Cornelius appears in the Prussian census with one son and three daughters, living in Rosenort, Gross Werder.  He belonged to the Rosenort Gemeinde, a Flemish congregation. He is referenced in the Elbing-Ellerwald church records where three of his children are listed on their weddings.  In all cases he is referred to as the late Kornelius Jantzen.  We know from these records that the family was living in Klein Holstein during this period of time.<br><br>In the 1772 Census he is listed in Rosenort, Gross Werder, with a wife, 2 sons over 10 years of age, 2 daughters under 10 and 1 daughter over 10.<br><br>This Kornelius has been confused with another Kornelius who lived around the same time, was married to Catherine De Veer of the well documented De Veer extended family, and who died in 1763. It seems to me extremely unlikely these are the same individual because there are records of the second Kornelius and his offspring throughout the available genealogical reference material and no points of commonality that would lead me to conclude they are one and the same.  The second Kornelius was probably the son of Dirk Jantzen and Anna Buhler.  Catharine was the daughter of Jacob De Veer and Maria Berentz.

<p style="margin-left:1in">He was variously documented as Hendrich or Heinrich.  He was one of the settlers in the second part of the first wave of immigrants who came from the Danzig area to Ukraine. Penner has documented him as arriving in 1795. The Danzig Family Book confirms they emigrated to Ukraine in 1795. Peter Rempel says he settled in Rosenthal. In 1806 this homestead is in the hands of his widow Susanna. Stumpp has a Jacob Heinrich Epp coming in 1795 from Hochzeit, Danzig; his birthdate here is given as 9 January 1757, a match with Heinrich. I think Stumpp must have made an error. Unruh shows similar information but with the correct name. Unruh says he first came to the village of Chortitza and then settled in Rosenthal. Since Penner's First Settlers list doesn't mention a village I interpret this to mean that he passed through Chortitza before securing a homestead in Rosenthal. The 1797 Chortitza Census acknowledges his presence in the colony but doesn't have him located in any village. He is at Neuenburg #20 in the 1801 Chortitza Census. Schapansky indicates he settled in Neuenburg (in 1802) before eventually putting down roots in Rosenthal.<br><br>The Grandma Database indicates he died in Neuenburg but he may have already moved to Rosenthal prior to his death. That is my impression from Rempel who states he was an original settler in Rosenthal.<br><br>Heinrich's brother, Peter, married Maria Penner, sister of Anna Penner. Anna was Heinrich's wife.<br><br>Heinrich's second wife, Margaretha Epp, was the daughter of David Epp. David Epp was the Elder in the Chortitza Mennonite Church who was likely guilty of all kinds of malfeasence and who excommunicated the Deputies Bartsch and Hoeppner in revenge for the charges they brought against him. I am unaware of any relationship between the David Epp family and the Heinrich Epp family.</p>

In the 1797 Chortitza Census he is listed without a village. In 1802 Unruh lists him as having died in Rosenthal and his homestead going to son in law Peter Epp. He is listed in the 1772 census, living in Schoensee and this gives us records of his children up to 1772. His age in that record makes it clear that the association with a son named Franz born in 1750 is incorrect as is the idea that Martin had a wife before Gertruda. This contradicts the information in the Grandma Database.<br><br>He was still living in Schoensee in 1790 when Deutsches Auslands-Institut records say he sold land to Johann Janzen and Maria Bergmann.<br><br>This is how I have pieced together the family in relation to the census material. Martin and Gertruda arrived in Chortitza in 1795 with a household of six. These would be the parents, son Gerhard (who died in 1801), daughters Catharina and Susanna, and one unexplained person. Already out of the household are older daughters Gertruda, Helena and Maria who were married previously, son Martin who died in 1777 and an unnamed daughter who died in 1789. This does not explain the 1776 census where the household is recorded as having one son and one daughter. In 1801 Martin has died, the farm has passed to daughter Catharina and her husband Peter Epp, and Gertruda is living with her daughter Catharina. The youngest daughter, Susanna, has moved to Chortitza to live with her sister Helena.<br><br>I note that his daughter Maria was married in Ladekop.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">There is uncertainty in the Grandma Database about Johann Regehr. <br><br>In the 1772 Census Johann is listed with his wife Catharina, and they both were born around 1716. The children listed in this census include:<br>Johann (1748);<br>Helena (1747);<br>Peter (1745);<br>Michael (1752);<br>Arendt (1754);<br>Catharina (1756); <br>Anna (1767); and<br>Maria (newborn).<br><br>It seems clear these are the children of Johann and Catharina, notwithstanding she was fairly old for having a new baby. Peter's year of birth is not consistent with census records after he immigrated to Chortitza. That said, it is quite certain the Peter in the 1772 Census is the same person as the settler in Chortitza; see the notes for Peter, which elaborate on this.<br><br>The Ladekop Church Book lists the birth of a number of children after the 1772 census. Among these are:<br>Heinrich (1775);<br>Martin (1778), with the caveat that I can not make out his name on the record but this is the interpretation given in the Grandma Database;<br>Abraham (1779);<br>Maria (1780); and <br>Heinrich (1781).<br><br>Not included in this list is Jacob, who is associated with a second wife of his father Johann. She was also named Catharina. The evidence for a second wife, other than the extreme age of the first wife when the latter children were born, is Rempel's immigration records, where Jacob appears accompanied in 1804 by his mother, Catharina, born around 1747, and his brother Abraham, age 24. Jacob was born around 1774, placing the second marriage around 1773. Obviously this is a different Catharina from the person in the 1772 Census. Unruh later reports Abraham living in Molotschna with his own family. With Abraham is his brother Martin. The same record shows that Catharina, Jacob's mother, is still living with Jacob, and her age is given as 65, indicating she was born around 1740. Later in 1810 the Molotschna Census indicates here year of birth was 1743. She had died before the 1811 census was taken.<br><br>The only child I can not reconcile is Aron (1767) as listed in the Grandma Database. Arendt (1754) is associated with the first wife of Johann, and Aron (1767) is associated with the second wife. These are variations of the same name and I think Aron belongs to a different family. I note that in Unruh, Aron does not emigrate from Schoensee, whereas his brothers all do.<br><br>Maria, the new-born at the time of the 1772 census, must have died in childhood, as evidenced by another child given the name Maria. Judging by the 1776 Census, which lists Johann and his wife with five sons and two daughters, it seems probably that Heinrich (1775) was not in the census. Nor was Aron, whom I have already eliminated from the family. It is unclear which daughters were included. <br><br>I note that the death record for a son named Heinrich in the Ladekop Church in 1793 has listed Heinrich as the son of Johan Regersche. This not only means that Heinrich's father predeceased him, it also means Heinrich's mother is still alive and a widow. Son Jacob was baptised in 1793 and this baptism record also indicates his father had predeceased him.<br><br>It is not clear whether or not he is in the 1789 Land Census. There are many Johann Regehrs listed. There are no widow Regehrs listed. One would think that with her large family of younger children she would be there.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Johann Theichgraf was a Flemish Mennonite.  He appears in the 1772 census records and the 1776 census records in Krebsfeld.  In the 1772 records he is noted as a Mennonite. In the 1776 census he is listed as a weaver. Their financial situation is schlecht, which Henry Schapansky interprets as not well off (a major portion of their income committed to food and shelter), but not poor.  Further, he is listed as an eigentumer, meaning an owner or proprietor.  Johann is listed with a wife, a son and a daughter.  These would be his wife Margaretha and his children Margareta and Heinrich.  He moved from Prussia, likely Kalthof, Marienburg, in 1789. He lived in Schoenhorst, Chortitza until his death in 1801. In 1802 his widow Katharina (his second wife) was living with her new husband, Peter Huebert, on the homestead formerly belonging to Johann and Katharina.  His daughter Margareta does not appear in the census, indicating that she was married by the time of the census.  The Grandma Database gave the approximate marriage date that I have used for Johann and Margaretha.<br><br>It appears that his first wife, Margaretha, died before the family emigrated. It seems that Johann emigrated with his second wife, Katharina.<br><br>His son Heinrich has a computed birth year of 1777 in some records but he must have been born in 1776 because he appears to be in the Prussian Census of that year. <br><br>Johann had a grandson named Peter who had an interesting story. This information is pieced together from Peter Goertzen's genealogy work, as noted in the source references, and comments from Marcy Bryon in correspondence with me. Although the title of Goertzen's work implies that Peter Teichroeb's father was a Johann, this seems unlikely because there are no Johann Teichroebs in the records for this time and place. My hypothesis is that he was the son of Jacob, who in turn was a son of Johann Teichroeb (1744). I don't know if this can be proven but he named his first son Jacob, a fairly standard protocol when the norm was to name the first son after the grandfather. In any case, Peter did exist and he married a woman by the name of Justina Wolf, who purportedly was actually a Niebuhr. Her mother was supposedly Johann Wolf's second wife Helena Niebuhr.  Whether Justina was the child of Helena's first marriage or born out of wedlock is unknown. Peter lived in Georgstal before his death. There is a map in the Peter Teichroeb genealogy book showing where he lived in that village. This map also shows where my great grandfather Peter Teichroeb lived in Olgafeld and where my great great grandfather Daniel Teichroeb lived in Georgstal. Marcy told me Peter went a little bit crazy when Justina died. He gave up the children and "walked the streets" for a period of time. Eventually he remarried. Something may be wrong with this story. Goertzen's book says Justina lived until 1915. Perhaps this is the year Peter's second wife died. I am going along with Marcy's story for now and assuming Justina died when the children were young.<br><br>Johann is related to Michael Teichroeb according to DNA evidence produced in the Mennonite DNA project.  They could be brothers or cousins or more distantly related. I have standardized the spelling of his name.</p>

Y DNA evidence indicates rather clearly that David is not a brother. However, the DNA data indicates a very close relationship between Gerhard Wilhelm Giesbrecht and Jacob and his brother Wilhelm. The DNA matches exactly. Therefore I hypothesize that Gerhard is a brother.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He was a Flemish Mennonite.  Stumpp and Unruh both list him coming to Ukraine from Tiegenhagen. He may have been originally from the Ellerwald Gemeinde in Prussia (Ellerwald 3 Trift), in 1772 and 1776. There are four David Doerksens listed in the 1776 census and only this one has a household with enough children to match this particular David.  He immigrated to Neuendorf in the Chortitza Colony, where he is found in 1788, 1793, 1795 and 1797. His widow appears in Glenn Penner's list of the original 228 settlers and it indicates he died before 1793; this is contrary to the 1795 revision list that demonstrates he was still alive. Both David and Maria are in the 1797 Census but neither are in the 1801 Census. The Bergthal Gemeinde Buch says he died before 1802 and this is confirmed by the 1802 homestead list showing his property passed to son Peter on his death.  According to the Chortitza Colony Vital Statistics for 1801 recording her death his wife was a widow. This calls into question a supposed fact found on various genealogy web sites.  There are claims David remarried in 1801 to a Susanna.  This is not correct.<br><br>David and his family appear on a list of Mennonites passing through Konigsberg in August 1788 on their way to Chortitza. <br><br>His daughter Anna doesn't appear in H. Schapanksy's work but she is listed in the Grandma Database.<br><br>His daughter Katarina married Cornelius Janzen. He migrated from Prussia to Neuendorf, Chortitza in 1789.  In the 1795 Chortitza Colony Census he is listed at Neuendorf.<br><br>Surnames such as this, based on first names, originate typically in Friesland in the Netherlands.<br><br>There are genealogical sites that associate him with a Gerhard Doerksen and Sara Klassen who could potentially be his parents. I have not been able to establish concrete links. However, the 1727 Brandt Register lists a Gerhard Doerksen in Tiegenhagen, putting him in the same place as David may have originated. <br><br>There are other incorrect relationships online that list David Doerksen as a grandchild of of a Gerhard who married Constantia Gilles. Her family has been traced back to the 14th century in France.  In fact one of her great uncles was a pioneer to New France, enlisting in the army and moving to Canada in the 1600s. He later married one of the women shipped to New France to become brides for the settlers (the "King's Daughters") and started a family.  One day when returning home with a hunting party the group was attacked by Iroquois warriors and he was hit with an arrow.  He succumbed to his injury. <br><br>While this is an interesting story it has been demonstrated as false. In fact the original publication that contains the correct genealogical work was published in 1905 and shows that the Doerksen family associated with Constantia Gilles is a different family. That said, the Danzig Church Book has entries for a number of people in that family, meaning they were members of the Danzig congregation in those years. The 1905 publication, entitled "Geschichte der familie Dirksen" can be found at <a href="https://www.rambow.de/geschichte-der-familie-dirksen.html">https://www.rambow.de/geschichte-der-familie-dirksen.html</a><br><br>There is Y-DNA evidence from a descendant of Julius Doerksen (1746), who is a son of a Gerhard Doerksen, and this Y-DNA is an exact 37-marker match with a sample from a descendant of David Dircks (1699) of Przechowka. David Dircks had a son named Gerht, but his wife is different from the wife of Julius' father. This leads me to think Gerhard Doerksen and David Dircks potentially are nephew and uncle. There is a Y-DNA test for David Doerksen (1740) and it has one mutation in comparison with the other two DNA samples. This leads me to think his grandfather could be a brother of David Dircks. It is very unlikely that a single mutation would extend beyond a generational distance of 10 generations from the sample providers to the common ancestor. In this case 10 generations takes us to the grandfather of David Doerksen (1740).</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">She came from Danzig to Rosenthal in 1788 with her husband.  She is also listed in Stumpp's entry relating to her husband; this is quite rare because in Stumpp's Mennonite records very few women are listed and wives are seldom referenced.  H. Schapansky says she was from Scharpau.  She appears in the Danzig Mennonite Church Book where it says she was baptized 1 July 1764 and was the daughter of Hans Entz.  Her name in the Danzig Church book is spelled Sannke.<br><br>According to the Grandma Database, one family record suggests that she may have been born in 1741.  The Helga Enns submission says she was born in 1741 and died on 2 March 1803. Irene Puttkammer (1996, written comments) indicates Susanna was born in 1749 and died on 2 March 1825, while Schapansky indicates that Susanna was born 6 April 1742 (as does Unruh in the census data) and was from Scharpau.  Adolf Ens, via Margaret Ewert, shows her birth date as 2 March 1741. Her death occurs between January and April 1803 in Rosenthal according to Chortitza Colony Vital Records, suggesting her date of death is 2 Mar 1803 rather than 2 May 1803.

<p style="margin-left:1in">He was a Flemish Mennonite.  Stumpp lists him as coming from Klein Montau, Grosswerder in the Heubuden Gemeinde in 1788.  He appears in the 1776 census with his four sons and two daughters and a wife.  The 1776 census lists his living condition as 'schlecht', which means simple, but not poor.  He was an original settler in Neuendorf, arriving with the 1789-1790 wave of immigrants. In later years he lived with his son Abraham in Neuendorf, where he is listed in 1795 and 1802. He was married to a woman named Helena Wieler, according to the Grandma Database. I have been unable to substantiate this but she doesn't appear in the 1795 census so she died prior to that date, possibly in Neuendorf.<br><br>I have been unable to reconcile the First Settlers count of household members. That document says 5 adults and 2 children comprised the household. I count Martin and Helena, adult son Martin, and younger sons Abram and Isaac. The three elder children were all married and all are accounted for as separate households in the First Settlers list.<br><br>He appears in the 1772 census with 2 Hufen and 9 Morgen of land. (about 92 acres). In that census the household is composed of 4 males over age 10, 3 under 10, 4 females over age 10 and 2 under. This total of 13 people does not match the 1776 census.<br><br>The birth of Martin's sons Isaac and Abraham appear in the Heubuden Church Records in Wernersdorf/Klein Montau. There are other Klassen births but no indication of whose children these are.<br><br>According to H. Schapansky Martin Klassen's son, Martin, came to Chortitza in 1788/89 with his father.
