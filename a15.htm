<p style="margin-left:1in">This hypothesis that he is the father of Jan De Veere is based only on information that Jan had Gijsbert as his middle name in records; usually that means his father was Gijsbert.

<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>24068.  Jakob Harnasveger</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#706"><sup>706</sup></a> son of <a href="a16.htm#i892"><b>Claes Harnasveger</a>,</b> was born about 1480 in Netherlands and died before 1563 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">According to the Grandma Database he was born between 1480 and 1500.  I found a reference to Jacob Harnasveger in a book by Irvin Horst, The Dutch Dissenters, in which he was quoted as saying "The papist regime would not hold out more than 22 months.".  A reference is then made to his trial on 6 April 1537.  Nothing further is said in the book.  Odette Franssen provides the death date and indicates that his father was named Claes, as Jakob's middle name, Claesz, suggests. She also suggests that he "...must have belonged to the anabaptist fellowship in 1534 under the leadership of the bishop Jacob van Kampen and the deacon Jan Paeuw at Amsterdam.".<br><br>Franssen sent me some of her research on Harnasveger. The historic context of this relates to the German city of Munster being taken over in February 1534 by radical anabaptists, who held it until July 1535. There followed a plot later in 1534 in Amsterdam with the intent to take over this city as well. That plot was foiled, and the perpetrators aimed to get to safety in Munster.  In October 1534 Harnasveger was part of a group of local anabaptists involved in assisting the plotters to escape from Amsterdam, apparently by boat, to Munster. His role was to provided weapons for the self-defense of the travelers. He was arrested and charged.  The court proceedings seem to have dragged on for a considerable time, during which he escaped the authorities once and was captured in The Hague on 5 July 1535. Eventually on 15 October 1535 he was sentenced to a two-year banishment from Amsterdam.  The historical records comment that this light sentence was due to the long running duration of the legal proceedings.  In fact, the prosecution had requested execution by decapitation.<br><br>He predeceased his wife according to her burial record. It was recorded that Dieuwer Jans, the widow of Jacob Harnasveger, was buried at the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam on 17 February 1563.<br><br>A rough translation of the Amsterdam Archives Records provided by Odette Franssen follows:<br><br>1534 October. The new sheriff took prosecution measures by arresting some figures who had been noticed because of their behavior during the visit of the governor or earlier. The point of indictment against them was mainly that they had tried to influence the officers of the militia during the raids on the Dam. They were people baptized by Jacob van Kampen, including Jan Evertsz. Van Wij, his neighbor Cornelis de Bakker, and Jacob de Harnasmaker. The probably no less guilty Jan van Schellingwoude fled from his trial and was banned from the city in absentia for eternity with the confiscation of his goods to the amount of 100 pounds (in accordance with the city privilege). Cornelis de Bakker, who had once housed five rebaptized persons, including the brother of the executed Jan Pouwelsz., was banished with his wife for seven years and Jacob the armor maker, who at the time had supplied weapons for those departing to Munster, for two years.<br> <br>1534 December 11. Judgment of Jacob Claesz. So my lords of justice have shown that Jacob Claesz Harnasveger, at the time the Anabaptists had prepared to sail to Munster, had sold and ordered certain guns for the benefit of the same Anabaptists and to that end he was twice in the company of people who have been gathered in the city without the consent and the will of the mayor, and that all those must not remain unpunished, so is Jacob Claesz sent over for correction and he will leave the city for the period of two years. This sentence was handed down on 10 December 1535 by Claes Hillebrantsz., Claes Heyn, Joost Buyck and Claes Basgen.<br> <br>1534 December 29th. Letter from Attorney General to Hof van Holland. Last night I apprehended three exiles from Amsterdam (including Jan van Schellingwoude and Jacob Claesz. Harnasveger) and sent them to the Hague because they were involved in the gathering at the gate throughout the Christmas period. These three prisoners have been among the principals of the uproar here in Amsterdam and know all the secrets. Today one of those imprisoned people, Jan Paeuw, has tried to name some of his companions and confesses to have spoken here in Amsterdam with a person sent from Munster representing Jan van Campen (Jacob van Campen), was a rebaptist, and has lived for a long time in The Hague but does not want this betrayal of his companions to become known. (The next paragraphs are indecipherable.) <br> <br>1535 January 23. Memorandum to the attorney general of Holland. We find Johan van Schellinckwoude and Jehan Pauw, also Cornelis Coenenz the baker and Jacob Harnasmaker guilty as charged of the commotion that occurred in the city of Amsterdam. Thus done and advised by the kingdom in Brussels on the 23 January 1535.<br> <br>1535. First days of May. Hendrik Goedbeleid must have taken care of the equipment of the brothers. A few days before, he had thirty pairs of warrior boots and a stock of weapons (swords, busses) prepared in quick succession. A later statement by Annetgen, the procurer, says that these weapons were bought from the wife of Jacob the armor-maker with the permission of Mr. Pieter Colin. In addition, Goedbeleid took a banner and a drum, which served during the advance to the dam.<br><br>1535 May 10. Riot on the Dam. <br>  <br>1535 May 17. First trial of Jacob van Campen. Jacob van Campen is a farmer from Yselmuden at Campen near Mastebrouck, aged 30 years. He confirmed that Jacob Harnasveger was baptized at the home of Jan Paeuw last summer. <br> <br>1535 October 15. In October 1535, in The Hague, the Court of Holland also ordered Jacob Claesz the armor-maker and Jan van Schellingwoude to sentences of two and five years respectively in exile. These relatively light sentences concluded a long-running procedure that went back to the disturbances in Amsterdam during the visit of the governor in the autumn of 1534. In the case of these two notorious heretics, the Attorney General had demanded execution by beheading. Jacob Claesz's contacts with Jacob van Kampen and Jan Paeuw were not unknown and Jan van Schellingwoude had owned forbidden books. For the investigation of this case, Counselor Sandelijn went to Amsterdam with a secretary. The verdict is remarkably mild considering the facts. Both prisoners also made an attempt to break out.<br>  <br>1537 in the Easter feast days. Cornelis Adriaansz Harnasveger examined under oath affirmed that in the Easter days he was at a meal in the house of Jacob Cock also attended by Jacob Harnasveger, who he witnessed saying that the papist regime would not last more than another 22 months. Gheryt Otsz, the servant of Cornelis Harnasveger, examined under oath, stated that he was also there and heard Jacob Harnasveger say this. Ael Ysbrants, Jacob Cock's wife affirmed under oath that at the time and place she heard a man sitting with them who said the papists were enjoying their final 21 or 22 months. <br> <br>1554 May 26 A child of Hernisveger, Claes Jacopsz. was buried at Amsterdam, Oude Kerk.<br> <br>1562 List of rebaptized persons joining the Mennonite sect: Claes Jacobssen Harnaschmaker in Sint Olofscapel.<br> <br>1563 February 17 Dieuwer Jans, the widow of Jacob Harnesmaecker buried on February 17 at Amsterdam, Oude Kerk.<br> <br>1584 June 3 The wife of Claes Jacobsz Harnisfeger, Claertijen Franssen was buried at Amsterdam, Oude Kerk.<br> <br>1597 Saturday, November 8: Frans Claesz.

<p style="margin-left:1in">Odette Franssen's ancestry site tells us that a Dieuwer, widow of Jacob Harnasveger and daughter of Jans, was buried at the Old Church on 15 February 1563 and mentions the Koestraet. The Oude Kirk is not situated on Koestraat but very near it.  I assume the interment was in a graveyard on Koestraat related to the church. The specific reference is "Begraven Oude Kerk: Dieuwer Jans dogter in de Koestraet (?) weduwe van Jacob Harnesmaecker den 17 februarij begraven." A source note is also given: Burial: GA Amsterdam DTB 1040, p.34 en p.35.<br><br>The Oude Kirk refers to a specific church in Amsterdam, dating back to the 13th century. Today it is a museum during the week and a Protestant church on Sundays.<br><br>The church was originally a wooden chapel built around 1213. Later it was replaced by a stone church and in 1306 it was consecrated by the bishop of Utrecht.  Saint Nicolas was its patron saint. Over the years numerous revisions and additions were made to the structure to complete the building that stands there today.  After the reformation in Amsterdam in 1578 it became a Calvinist Church. It remains a Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>24084.  Matthaus Maraun</b> <A HREF="sources.htm#709"><sup>709</sup></a> was born before 1470 in Konigsberg-Kneiphof, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and died in 1521 in Konigsberg-Kneiphof, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">The rationale for associating Matthaus Maraun with Georg Marun, the father of Gertrud is circumstantial. <br><br>The Piwkowski Genealogy lists a Matthaus Maraun born in Konigsberg-Kneiphof, a small district in Konigsberg. Piwkowski indicates that the alternate form for Matthaus is Thewes, and this is the form we see in Teutonic Order records referring to Matthaus in the early 1500s. In this genealogy two sons are listed: Kurt (1490-1547) and Georg. Both sons were born in Konigsberg. Kurt died in Danzig. Georg appears in a school record in 1518, implying that he must have been born between 1500 and 1510. The google translation says he attended high school (probably meaning the Gymnasium).<br><br>Piwkowski says that the the alternate form of Kurt is Conrad, and we see this in one reference to him in the Teutonic Order records for the year 1523. He appears on the matriculation registration list for the University of Frankfurt in 1511. It appears that Kurt lived in Danzig from 1531 until his death in 1547. He was a Councillor and Magistrate there. He died of the plague and may have been buried in St. Mary's Church in Danzig. St. Mary's was originally a Catholic Basilica. Lutheran services were introduced in 1536, concurrent with Catholic services. This continued until 1572 when Catholic services were discontinued.<br><br>The Lilienthal Genealogy lists a Matthaus Maraun who was a merchant in Kneiphof and this database has records showing he lived in Kneiphof in 1512 and 1516. One daughter is listed: Regina (-1595) who married Peter Glogau in 1563. Glogau was born in 1494, placing him in the same generational line as the sons of Matthaus. Regina and Peter had a daughter Anna born in 1564.<br><br>The Joachim von Roy genealogy lists one daughter for Georg Maraun: Gertrud, who married in 1587. This puts her birth around 1560, around the same time as the daughter of Regina and Peter. The import of this is that it makes it plausible from a dating perspective that this Georg Maraun in the same person as Georg, the son of Matthaus. <br><br>Von Roy tells us that the Maraun family was an important patrician and business family in Konigsberg. We have evidence that Matthaus was a businessman of signifigance. See the reference to the Virtual Prussian Document Book.<br><br>There are two references to the widow of Matthaus Maraun in the Prussian Cultural Archives, dated 1523. There are multiple references to Matthaus leading up to 1519 in the Regesta Historico-Diplomatica and then beginning in 1521 references to his widow Katharina. I gather he must have died around 1521.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">We know her name was Katharina from Konigsberg records that name her explicitly as Katharina, widow of Matthaus (Thewes is the form used in the records).<br><br>Her sister was Ursula, possibly Marquard. Ursula was the wife of Bernt Pyning, large scale merchant, Councilor and judge in Konigsberg-Kneiphof. Based on records from Konigsberg it seems that Ursula and Bernt had a daughter (name unknown) who married Hans Fahrenheid. They had children. Both Bernt and Ursula died (Ursula in 1522) and Katharina was cited in the records working to have the estate settled and there is a further reference to the children of Fahrenheid. I suspect those parents died earlier and Katharina had an obligation to care for the children.</p>
