<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>6016.  Gijsbert DeVeer</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#674"><sup>674</sup></a> son of <a href="a14.htm#i190"><b>Jan DeVeer</a>,</b> was born 14 May 1556 in Schiedam, Netherlands, was baptized in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and died 17 May 1615 in Danzig. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Gysbert was the son of Jan De Veer.  His middle name, Jansz, is a reference to his father. Horst Penner says he was born in Schiedam, not far from Rotterdam.  Luise Dick, in her Dick-Schmidt Ancestry, concurs.  James Fehr tells us he thrived due to the merchant trade he developed between Danzig and Amsterdam.  He married in 1580 and settled in Danzig sometime between 1583 and 1588 according to Fehr.  He was among the first to join the Danzig Mennonite Church.  He was in the grain trading business.  The Nederlandsche Leeuw genealogy says more specifically he was a grain merchant in Danzig and Amsterdam and Fehr confirms he traded on the North Sea trading route between the Netherlands and the Baltic coast.  He returned to Amsterdam from Danzig in 1600 and was wealthy enough to become a citizen there in 1601.  He returned to Danzig in 1612 and died there.  His descendents lived in Amsterdam and Danzig and carried on the successful trading business he founded. Luise Dick is the source for the location of his baptism.<br><br>Odette Franssen notes that his son, Nicolaes, was a "merchant and Baltic navigator". The family appeared to be involved in commercial activities spanning Amsterdam and Danzig.  She also says he was a teacher or minister in the Mennonite community in Amsterdam. Gysbert's son Harman was a merchant in Amsterdam and Danzig.<br><br>His son Isaac Isaac had to be born in Danzig because his parents lived there from about 1583-4 until 1600 when they returned to Amsterdam for about 12 years.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">I have used date approximations from the Grandma Database.  The Grandma Database lists its source as the Ancestry of David Dick &amp; Katharina Schmidt, Clearbrook, BC Mennonite Centre.  The year of death I have used is published on the Meissner site at myheritage.com. I have no source reference for this date.<br><br>Horst Penner lists Philipp as one of the Mennonite congregants in Gross Werder (Marienburg Region).  <br><br>He may have had a son named Philipp but I have found no concrete information about this, only Internet sources without source citations.<br><br>His father may have been named Johannes based on some Internet references. I have found no proof of this.<br><br>He had a daughter named Agneta or Apeta. I am unsure if her name is correctly spelled Apeta, as shown in De Nederlandsche Leeuw, or if it should be Ageta as shown in the original work done by Calmeyer in 1929, or possibly the way Ulrich Dueck spells it. I have used the latter.<br><br>He may have had a son named Klaas. Information about him is found in the Luise Dick's Dick-Schmidt Ancestry but no mention of him is made in the Nederlandsche Leeuw.<br><br>Names such as this with 'Van' generally originate in the South and Spanish Netherlands. More specifically Penner says the name Van Dyck originates in Flanders, a county in the Spanish Netherlands at the time.<br><br>There are web sites indicating Philipp's father was Gysbert op den Dyck from Wesel in the Westphalia region of Germany, and his mother was Maria Ryswick. The op den Dyck genealogy is well researched in a book entitled "The op Dyck Genealogy" by Charles Wilson Opdycke, published in 1889.  This book does not contain any references to Philipp Van Dijck. <br><br>From a geographic standpoint this relationship is tenable.  Henry Schapansky says that one of the main centers of the Radical Reform movement, of which the Mennonite movement was a part, was the Lowlands area around the Maas and Rhine river deltas and adjacent territories. This reformation movement sprang up long before the Netherlands was the modern country constituted as we know it. The area was comprised of modern day Netherlands, Flemish speaking parts of modern Belgium and France, East Friesland and the northern lower Rhine area of modern Germany (of which Westphalia is a part). Opdycke's book speaks at length about the Reformation and the resulting inquisition.<br><br>However, a thorough study of the research in this Opdycke genealogy disproves the possibility of a family relationship to Philipp Van Dijck. It is clear that Gysbert was a prominent member of the Wesel community all through the period in which Philipp was born and raised in Danzig. Gysbert was a town councillor for many years and held other civic administration positions as well.  Unless information arises to indicate Philipp was a child of Gysbert in Wesel and only later lived in Danzig it seems clear this hypothesis is disproven.  <br><br>There are other absurd familial relationships in the online databases that indicate many genealogical errors.  The most common information shows Gysbert with four children, Anne (born 1563 in Wesel), Philip (born 1564 in Danzig), Lodowick (born 1565 in Netherlands) and Sara (born about 1650 in New York). Obviously Sara is not a daughter and if she exists it is a few generations later on a different continent. Anne is always shown married to a Deric Kalenbuiter; this Anne is actually a sister of Gysbert. Philip has been discussed above.  Whether Lodowick was born in Germany or Netherlands isn't clear but the Opdycke book points to Wesel in Germany.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>6019.  Maria Grauwert</b> <A HREF="sources.htm#678"><sup>678</sup></a> was born about 1568 in Klein Mausdorf, Marienburg Region, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and died after 1606 in Danzig. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">There are numerous hits on the Internet all showing a death date of 1606. I haven't found a concrete source for this date. It may simply related to the birth of her daughter, Maria, in 1606, in which case she may have lived longer.  I imagine she died in Danzig. Ulrich Dueck indicates she was born in Klein Mausdorf in the Marienburg region. Her husband Philipp was there in 1592 according to Horst Penner. <br><br>In a random Internet search I found another son of Philipp and Maria, Philipp Van Dijck, born around either 1600 or 1610.  I can't find any source to confirm his existence. <br><br>There is genealogy work appearing on many web sites showing her father as Cornelius Grauwert.  I have not been able to find any substantiating sources yet. There is a Cornelius Grauwert who married Magdalene van Ammersfort in 1587, probably in Danzig. Magdalene was born in Danzig in 1567. This precludes Cornelius and Magdalene from being Maria's parents. However, Cornelius was a son of Johann Grauwert and I can imagine a scenario where Johann is the father of siblings Cornelius and Maria. Coincidentally, Cornelius Grauwert had a second wife, according to Ulrich Dueck. She was Anna van Dijck. It is interesting that Anna's surname is the same as Philipp Van Dijck, husband of Maria Grauwert.<br><br>Ulrich Dueck has identified a number of individuals named Grauwert in Utrecht dating back to the fourteenth century. It appears that some members of the Grauwert family were leaders in the Church. Tydemannus Grauwert was the Carthusian Prior in Brugge in the fourteenth century. A couple men were Canons of the St. Salvator Church in Utrecht beginning with Johannes who held that post until his death in 1369. Walter Grauwert was also a Canon until his death in 1456. Walter was a deacon at St. Salvator prior to this, beginning in 1429. Finally, Dirk Grauwert was a deacon at St. Salvator in the years before his death in 1476. It is unclear how these men relate to each other or to the Mennonite Grauwerts in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the sixteenth century.<br><br>St. Salvator was built around 695-724. It was destroyed in 1587-1588.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>6020.  Anthonius Von Roy</b> <A HREF="sources.htm#683"><sup>683</sup></a> was born about 1560. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Joachim von Roy indicates that Anthonius, the father of Katharina and Johann, is probably the father of Wilhelm, Peter and Sara, although possibly the father is Peter von Roy. Joachim von Roy said, in a blog post on Heraldik im Netz, that the first record of a von Roy affiliating with Reformers is Anthonius when he married Gertrud Maraun in the Calvinist Church of Saint Peter and Paul in Danzig. <br><br>Based on what I have read of Joachim's research it seems certain that the von Roy family were members of the aristocracy in Polish Prussia.<br><br>The date of death of son Peter's wife Maria is given by Joachim von Roy and it matches the date of death in the Danzig Church Book for an unnamed wife of a von Roy. This correspondence supports Joachim's data and it also indicates that some members of the family were members of the Mennonite congregation by this time. <br><br>Anthonius' daughter Katharina and son Johann were baptised in the Reformed Church of Saint Peter and Paul in Danzig.<br><br>Construction of the Church of Saint Peter and Paul began in the 1390s. It burned down in the 1420s in a great fire in the Danzig suburbs where it was located. It was rebuilt in the 1450s and was a Catholic Parish Church until 1557 or 1577 when it became a Lutheran Church. By 1590 it had been taken over by the Reformed Church. In 1622, it became the main Calvinist Temple in Danzig. At the time of Anthonius' wedding the status of the church would have been questionable; it was in transition from a Lutheran to a Calvinist property. Based on information about the von Roy wedding the church property could have been shared by both congregations.<br><br>Joachim von Roy says that one of Anthonius' great grandsons, Wilhelm (grandson of Peter), was permitted to convert from the Calvinist Church to the Mennonite Church after which he married a Magdalena Goosen. <br><br>Joachim von Roy goes on to say that the Goosen family was particularly widespread in Elbing, where the students Abraham Goosen (a Hollender) entered the grammar school in Elbing in september 1598, Wilhelm Gossen (a Hollender) in 1604, Heinrich Goosen in 1641 and Isaak Goosen in 1643. This is significant because it points to a greater level of educational integration than is generally understood to have been accepted by Mennonites. Certainly there is are many writers who indicate that Mennonites opted to manage their own educational affairs within their community. This is not necessarily the case.</p>
