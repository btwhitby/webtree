Peter Teichroeb</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#5"><sup>5</sup></a> son of <a href="a5.htm#i760"><b>Daniel Teichroeb</a></b> <A HREF="sources.htm#13"><sup>13</sup></a> and <a href="a5.htm#i764"><b>Maria Abrams</a></b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#14"><sup>14</sup></a> was born on 2 Aug 1857 in Schoenhorst, Chortitza, Ukraine and died on 6 Dec 1944 in Wingard, Saskatchewan. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He lived in Georgstal with his family prior to his marriage to Agatha. After their marriage, Peter and Agatha moved to Olgafeld. After Agatha died, he married her sister Maria.  <br><br>When Peter moved the family to Canada, Maria refused to emigrate.  She was firmly against emigrating. The reason for this has never been understood but I believe she had a few children still living in Ukraine in 1925 and she may not have wanted to abandon them. One son did move to Canada in 1926 but other children are unaccounted for. <br><br>Apparently Peter referred to Maria as "the housekeeper", based on recollections of his son Daniel. There is a photograph of Peter's daughter Anna and her family in which a figure dressed in a long black dress has been removed. No one really knows who this person is. My aunt Esther recalls that her mother, Maggie Schapansky, said it was someone who did not consider herself part of the family. This leads me to conclude the person is Maria. She may have edited herself out of the picture to disassociate herself with the family who left for Canada. <br><br>Maria's first husband was a David Rempel, according to a book entitled "Peter Rempel Family History".<br><br>Peter was living in Wingard, Saskatchewan with his daughter Katharina when he died.  Apparently he had been sick for more than three days with a ruptured intestine. He is buried at the Horse Lake Cemetery.<br><br>Peter's brother Daniel moved to Manitoba in 1912, according to family information.<br><br>Peter's daughter Katharina came to Canada in 1925 aboard the Empress of France with her husband and two children. Also on the ship were here sister Helena and Helena's family. Katharina's husband, Jacob Leppki, died shortly after arriving in Canada. I have a picture of him in his coffin at the funeral. My father says her second husband was Johann Reimer, with whom she had two sons. Her third husband was Jacob Wiebe. My father also recalled her year and place of birth.<br><br>Peter's daughter Agatha came to Canada in 1912. She appears as a steerage passenger aboard the S.S. Saturnia originating in Glasgow and landing in Quebec in September 1912 with children Agatha, Elizabeth, Peter and Isaac. According to my father she married Wilhelm Dyck. Wilhelm arrived on the same ship as his family, three months later, in December 1912. The Grandma Database tells us that he was held up en route because of an eye problem. Both passenger lists indicate a final destination of Rosthern.<br><br>Peter's daughter Helena came to Canada aboard the Empress of France with her husband, Bernhard Petkau, and their daughter, Maria.<br><br>My father recalls that Peter's daughter Anna married Gerhard Giesbrecht. They owned the flour mill in Fuerstenland. In the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution they lost the mill but were allowed to remain there as workers at the mill. My grandfather, Dan Teichroeb, would send care packages after he got to Canada. Eventually they received word that Anna and Gerhard were dead. This was around 1934. I have seen data indicating Gerhard died in 1933 and Anna moved to Poland in 1943-4. This is substantiated by records in the Einwandererzentrallestelle (EWZ) Files. Anna was swept up in the German retreat from Ukraine in 1943-4 when the Nazis relocated hundreds of thousands of German speaking inhabitants from the occupied territories. Anna was placed in Leszno, Poland. After the war ended the "repatriated" Mennonites in Poland and Germany were loaded on boxcars and sent to Kazakhstan, a member state of the USSR. I have a letter written by Anna's daughter Maria to my grandfather Daniel Teichroeb in 1972 in which she mentions that her mother Anna had died in October 1963. The envelope indicated it originated in Stepnoe, Zhambyl Region, Kazakhstan. It was sent by Maria Janzen meaning that Maria married a Janzen. In the letter Maria referred to her age in relation to her birthday on 4 December. This is in accordance with the old Julian calendar that was in use in Russia at the time of her birth in 1915. Other modern records such as the Grandma Database have this date corrected to the Gregorian calendar date of 17 December. Maria refers to a daughter who has turned 14 years of age. No name is given but it stands to reason that a daughter born around 1958 is still alive. Maria's middle name on the envelope is Yegorovna, which I understand is a common way of writing daughter of Gerhard in the Russian manner.<br><br>Gerhard Giesbrecht is mentioned in an issue of Die Mennonitische Rundschau (cited here) on 12 April 1933 where it says that he died of starvation on his way to the Torgsin shop in Nikopol. Arnold Neufeld-Fast says that the Torgsin shop was the hard currency shop in the vicinity and likely Gerhard was heading there to pick up a package (I can imagine it was from family in Canada). The article says (roughly): "We get anxious when we think about how long it will be until we next get food. That is why I ask, for those of us in need in Russia, not to withdraw your support. Gerhard Giesbrecht, who lives in Michaelsburg, died of hunger on his way to Nikopol to Torgsin. Please help us." The article was written by Abram Klassen.<br><br>Die Mennonitische Rundschau also published a letter on 11 January 1933 written by Anna to her family begging for assistance. Roughly translated it says: "Fuerstenland, Michaelsburg. Wishing you all the best and the peace of God. Since we are living in dire hunger and only have rags to wear and are covered in ulcers, we come again with the request, ask for us from outside people or the Board, maybe there is some help, because we are dying, hunger hurts a lot. If all 5 children ask, and mother has just has a piece of bread, it's fine. Dear sister, if you are still sickly, pray for us for as long as you are alive. May our brothers and sisters remain in love until we return. If the good Lord would soon deliver us from our world, that is our prayer. Anna Giesbrecht". The letter ends with their mailing address in Michaelsburg. Apparently the request was answered with the package that Gerhard was after in April.<br><br>Specific data taken from the EWZ files:<br><br>-Anna was "passed through" which I think means settled in Poland on 23 August 1944. The same document indicates husband Gerhard's death date in 1933. The document also says that son Peter was arrested on 2 September 1941. (Doc. # C012-1644) Thus far I have not been able to track down the specifics related to Peter. Peter was born 1 August 1917.<br><br>-The events of 2 September 1941 (From Arnold Neufeld-Fast): 31,320 ethnic German men (they were categorized by "race" on their identity cards) between 16 and 60 from the Zaporizhzhia Oblast were deported to the Soviet interior in September 1941. Among these, thousands of Mennonite men aged 16 to 60 were arrested east of the Dnieper in the first week of September 1941, just prior to the mass deportation of much of the German speaking population two to three weeks later. The arrest was under articles 54-10 of the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian SSR and 35 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR. Fifty-six Mennonite men from Michaelsburg were rounded up that week and typically sentenced to correctional labour camps.<br><br>-Anna's daughter Maria was settled on 23 August 1944. (Doc. # C013-2056)<br><br>-Anna's daughter Anna was settled on 19 July 1944. (Doc. # C012-1936)<br><br>-Anna's daughter Margaretha was settled on 19 October 1943. (Doc. # C013-1808)<br><br>-Anna's daughter Agatha was settled on 23 August 1944. (Doc. # D042-1332)<br><br>Peter's daughter Maria arrived in Saint John, New Brunswick in December 1926, a third class passenger aboard the S.S. Metagama. With her were her husband, Jacob Redekop, and children Isaac, Sarah, Maria, Peter, Heinrich and Agatha. Maria was 46 and Jacob was 52. The passenger list says they came from Michaelsburg, Fuerstenland, and the ship originated in Liverpool. She died in Saskatoon in 1949. My father remembers the year because he had recently moved to Saskatoon to work. That was in 1949.<br> <br>Peter's daughter Margaretha came to Canada with her father and the rest of the family in 1925 at the age of 39. Margaretha married a John Giesbrecht and they had a son named Menno Peter. Peter Teichroeb is the source of the information about her husband.<br><br>Peter's son Johann came to Canada with his family at the same time as Peter and moved to British Columbia.<br><br>Peter's son Heinrich left Ukraine on 16 March 1922, got as far as Germany, and contracted Typhus. He died alone in a boarding house on 28 May 1922. Apparently he travelled on a passport belonging to a good friend who had died earlier. The family of this friend were Germans and they were evicted from Ukraine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Agatha was Peter's first wife.  Her sister Maria, widow of David Rempel was Peter's second wife.  We know something about their mother Anna Hiebert because her death is recorded in Daniel Teichroeb's journal.  We know the name of their father because he is mentioned as Agatha's father in the Fuerstenland Baptism records for Daniel Teichroeb (b. 1904).<br><br>Agatha may have had a brother Johann who was a blacksmith.  Ben Fast was the source of this piece of information. Although it is possible that Ben was thinking of Agatha's father, Johann Dyck, who definitely was a blacksmith, the obituary for her mother, Anna Hiebert, appears to be written by one of the sons, Johann Dyck. This much appears to be consistent with the information from Ben Fast.<br><br>Family information indicates Agatha had a nephew whose name might have been Abraham. He apparently was born around 1900 and died around 1988 in Manitoba. The Grandma Database lists a son of Agatha's brother, Heinrich, who was named Abraham and was born in Manitoba in 1911 and died in British Colombia in 1990. This is probably the same person and detailed inconsistencies are the result of faded memories.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Ben Fast's book "Fast - Epp Genealogy" has a map of Rosenthal showing the location where Jacob Fast was born.  Until the age of 12 he attended the local village school in Rosenthal. His teacher there was David H. Epp. Ben says he attended Zentralschule (secondary school) in Halbstadt Molotschna from 1888 to 1891. However, his wife, Helena Epp, in the obituary she wrote, says he attended the Chortitzer Central School. I don't know how to reconcile these assertions but I assume he went to schol in Chortitza because he lived in the Chortitza settlement. Here he had his formal training as a teacher. He immigrated to Canada in 1892 with his parents. They stopped over in Manitoba for nearly a year.  According to Ben he was a teacher in Molotschna but never taught in Canada. On the contrary, Helena Epp says he taught school in Manitoba during the ten months the Fast family lived there before moving to the Northwest Territories (Saskatchewan). Helena Epp says that he often commented that this was one of the happiest periods of his life. <br><br>In October, 1897 Jacob applied for a 160 acre homestead in Saskatchewan. The homestead was ten miles west of Rosthern and three miles south of Laird. In the spring of 1898, using a yoke of borrowed oxen and a single share plough, he began breaking sod to clear enough acreage to file a homestead claim.  The rule was that 30 acres had to be cleared and buildings erected before title would be granted to a 160 acre quarter section. In 1900 he finished clearing his land and in 1901 obtained title to the quarter section. He later purchased two more quarter sections. He and Helena lived on the homestead and farmed until is death.  His son Ben says that all their children were born there. He farmed thereafter. <br><br>Prior to his wedding to Helena Epp, Jacob built a log cabin and a temporary log barn. It took the help of his brothers and many neighbours to do this. With whitewashed walls, nails for clothes hooks, rough boards for shelving and apple crates for chairs it was the kind of settler home one would envision. A fireplace burning poplar logs provided heat and kerosene lamps lit the cabin.<br><br>In those days the essential implements were a plough, harrow, seeder, mower and a rake, along with a team of oxen. In addition, for basic transportation and grain haulage a team of horses was needed.  Ben says the round trip to Rosthern for supplies and mail or to deliver grain was 50 miles and generally required two days.<br><br>He appears with his wife in the 1901 census in Saskatchewan, sub district of Waldheim, page 6, entry #45.<br><br>He was a member of the Rosenort congregation in the Eigenheim church in Saskatchewan.<br><br>Jacob did not continue teaching after the brief period in Manitoba but he was an active promoter of education. Amy (Enns) Loewen has told me that his older children attended Danzig School. His younger children attended Carmen School when it was built. Jacob was an organizer of the German English Academy, established in 1905 as a high school. It later became the Rosthern Junior College.<br><br>His obituary indicates that he had a difficult life in terms of his health. He passed this on to his son, Albert. Helena Epp says that he had serious health issues and abdominal problems so severe that he had periods of as many as ten days when he could not eat anything. In Autumn 1938 he was hospitalized with severe issues including bladder problems. He underwent surgeries that did not resolve his problems and eventually, bed ridden, he succumbed to his illness at the age of 65.<br><br>Jacob is buried in the Laird Old Town Triangle Cemetery.</p>

Amy (Enns) Loewen has told me that she attended Madchen Schule (Girl's School) there before her family emigrated to Canada in the 1890s.<br><br>Helena moved off the farm to Laird around 1941, not long after Jacob died.  She sold the farm house which was then moved to Waldheim by the new owners. She bought a house in Laird and I remember it. There was an outhouse that was amazing to me as a young child. I remember when she got an indoor toilet - it was a chemical toilet placed in her closet. She was very old then and this was a tremendous improvement in her quality of life. Helena's house is still there and looks much like it did in the early 1960's.<br><br>Helena's son John took over the family farm and he stayed with farming for most of his life.<br><br>Helena is buried in the Laird Old Town Triangle Cemetery.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Her parents settled in Reinland Manitoba, and Anna was probably born there. By the time of the 1906 Census she had moved to the Humboldt Saskatchewan area with her family. Information from her death certificate says she lived in Saskatchewan for 45 years. This is not quite accurate.  She appears in the 1901 Census in Plum Coulee.  This census gives her birth date as used here, contrary to the October 1890 birthdate used in some other sources. According to family records concerning Wilhelm Striemer, they married in Saskatchewan.  Apparently she had a sister Helena who married an Abram Friesen.  She is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery (14A-L025-NH) in Saskatoon.</p>
