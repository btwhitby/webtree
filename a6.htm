Daniel Teichroeb</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#49"><sup>49</sup></a> son of <a href="a7.htm#i34"><b>Michael Teichroeb</a></b> <A HREF="sources.htm#100"><sup>100</sup></a> and <a href="a7.htm#i36"><b>Aganetha Dyck</a></b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#101"><sup>101</sup></a> was born on 22 Feb 1789 in Gross Usnitz, Stuhm Lowlands, Prussia and died on 5 Jan 1857 in Schoenhorst, Chortitza, Ukraine. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Daniel was a son of Michael Teichroeb of Kalthof by his third wife Anganetha.  Daniel immigrated to Molotschna with his mother and siblings in 1803.  She is listed as a widow at the time. By 1804 she is listed as the wife of Abraham Neudorff in Muntau, Molotschna. As recently as the 1811 Molotschna Census Daniel was still living in Muntau with his mother and step father.  <br><br>In an entry associated with Neudorff we find that Daniel was married in Chortitza on 5 July 1813. This was his first of three wives and the date corresponds with the marriage record in the Chortitza Colony Vital Records 1801-1813. This first wife was Maria, the widow of Bernard Krahn. Anna Wolf of Schoenhorst was his second wife. Daniel and Anna Wolf are listed in the Schoenhorst church registry as the parents of Daniel born in 1835. This son Daniel maintained a journal of family records, recorded in the mid - 1800's.  His father's date of death and age are recorded there, establishing continuity in the records. This journal spells his last name as Teihreb and I have seen it in other sources spelled Teigrob. Daniel appears in Schoenhorst in the 1847 list of Chortitza householders. I assume he died there.<br><br>The May 1814 Chortitza Census lists Daniel as a landowner in Burwalde with his wife, Maria, and her daughters Margaretha (age 10) and Katharina (age 8). In the October 1814 Chortitza Census Katharina is not listed. Margaretha is listed as 8 years old. The November 1815 Chortitza Census lists the same family and confirms that Maria's first husband, Bernhard Krahn, died in 1813. Daniel Teichroeb had taken over the farm when he married the widow.<br><br>Maria (widow) Krahn was Daniel Teigrob's first wife.   She must have died before 1835 because Daniel had remarried by then.  Maria appears in Burwalde and Rosenthal.  She is in the 1801 Rosenthal census and shown as 22 years of age.  She appears there as the wife of Bernhard Krahn, with two daughters, Maria and Diana (probably Anna). These appear to be the daughters of Bernhard's first wife Katharina Andreas who died in November 1800. Maria lived in Burwalde until at least 1816 based on available census records. I assume she died there although she might have died in Schoenhorst, depending on when Daniel Teichroeb moved there from Burwalde.<br><br>Maria and Bernard Krahn had a daughter, Margaretha Krahn. She married Peter Abrams and they had a daughter, Maria Abrams. Maria married Daniel Teichroeb's son, Daniel.<br><br>Maria Lehn was Daniel Teigrob's third wife according to H. Schapansky. I suspect she died in Schoenhorst because as recently as 1847 Daniel and his second wife were living there. She had migrated to Neuendorf in 1796 and married her first husband there.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Anna was Daniel's second wife.  She was the daughter of Johann Wolf of Schoenhorst.  This is confirmed by the entry in the 12 August 1809 Chortitza smallpox vaccination list, which gives her location as Schoenhorst, her age as 2 years, and identifies her father as Johann Wolf.  Her brother Johann is also listed. Her birth is also listed in the Chortitza Vital Records. Anna and Daniel appear in the Schoenhorst Church Register along with the birth of their son Daniel in 1835. I assume they were married in Schoenhorst because she was born their and they lived there when Daniel was born.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Rempel says he came alone to Ukraine, with a passport issued in Danzig on 18 August 1820.  H. Schapansky says he was a son of Abraham Abrams who migrated to Molotschna in 1818. Unruh indicates that Peter originated in Montau and settled in Molotschna in 1819. What seems clear is he came to Molotschna alone and later moved to Chortitza and married a woman born in Ukraine. Peter is listed in Schoenhorst in the 1863 Signature List (referring to the grain loans of that year).<br><br>Peter's date of death is from information posted on myheritage.com by Thomas Hiebert.<br><br>Regarding son Peter (1827-1874), dates relating to him are supposedly found in "West Reserve Bergthal Church Register No. 1". I have not seen these records. Whether he is actually a son of Peter Abrams (1798-1856) is based on the Grandma Database and I can't substantiate this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Her year of birth is calculated as 1803 or 1804 by some sources.  The Vital Records say she was born in 1803 between January and April in Burwalde. The 12 August 1809 smallpox vaccination list that shows her as Bernhard Krahn's daughter, age 4, in Burwalde. Her sister Catharina is also listed, age 3. I took the death date from the Wiebe family tree on ancestry.ca. The Grandma Database indicates a sister also named Margaretha who predeceased her, having been born in 1803 and dying in infancy. I'm not sure this is correct because there are no other daughters of this name in the Vital Records.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">The connection between Johann Dyck and Helena Friesen and their children is taken from the Grandma Database, which in turn relies on information from Odessa Archive, Fund 6, Inventory 5, File 112.  I have not seen this data. However, if we assume the information in the Grandma Database is correct and the ancestors of Johann (1824-1892) are Johann and Helena, then it is possible to identify these two people from census records. They first appear together in the 1815 census in Neuendorf living among the landless. The appear subsequently in the 1816 census, still in Neuendorf. They have no children at this point.<br><br>Indications are the elder Johann arrived in Ukraine in the 1803 wave of settlement, according to annotations in the transcribed census records for 1815 (Neuendorf #63). This implies the family was heading to Molotschna and this is what we find in the immigration and census records. <br><br>Peter Rempel lists a Johann Dyck and his wife Agneta who passed through Grodno in 1804 on their way to Molotschna. With them were sons Johann (age 11), Arend (age 8), Jacob (age 6) and Heinrich (age 2). The family was moving from the Danzig area of Prussia. <br><br>In the 1806 Molotschna Census Johann and Agatha appear at Lichentau #10 with children Johann (age 14), Hermann (age 12), Jacob (age 8), Heinrich (age 6) and Elisabeth (infant). Arend and Hermann must be the same child. <br><br>Unruh's 1808 census records for Molotschna list the family arriving in Molotschna in 1805, farmers originating in Tiegenhagen in the Tiegenhof jurisdiction. They have with them Johann (age 16), Hermann (age 14), Jacob (age 10), Heinrich (age 7) and Elisabeth (age 2). <br><br>In the November 1811 census the family is still at Lichtenau #10; the children are Johann (age 19), Hermann (age 17), Jacob (age 13), Heinrich (age 10), Elisabeth (age 5) and Anna (age 2). <br><br>By the time of the 1835 census Johann the elder has died (1831) but his wife Agata is still at Lichtenau #12 with Herman (age 40), Jacob (age 35), Jacob's wife Agneta, Elisabeth (age 28) and Anna (age 25). Heinrich had moved to Fischau in 1827. There is no mention of son Johann.<br><br>At some point around or after the 1811 Molotschna Census Johann moved out on his own. He must have moved to Neuendorf.  In the 1811 Chortitza Census Johann Dyck (age 18) appears at Neuendorf #8 as the foster son of Diedrich Rempel and Elisabeth Dyck. In the 1814 census Johann is still living with his foster parents. In the 1815 census Diedrich and Elisabeth are still living in Neuendorf, but they are alone now and at this point we find a Johann Dyck (age 23) and his wife Helena (age 18) living at Neuendorf #63. The annotation on the transcribed census says that Johann may have come to Ukraine in 1803. In the 1816 census Johann (age 24) and his wife Helena (age 18) are still in Neuendorf.<br><br>I found a record in the Wall/Epp Diary mentioning the death of Johann's son Herman in 1843. Later in 1848 there are entries for the death of a Johann Dueck (der gross) and his wife. The marriage of his daughter Anna is listed in 1850. The original connection between Johann and his children is taken from the Grandma Database and further research is required to establish source references. The diary entries correspond well to the data in the Grandma Database. The Grandma Database also tells us that when he died in Neuendorf in 1848 his property passed to another family. <br><br>His daughter Anna is mentioned in the Jacob Epp diaries in connection with her marriage to Suderman in 1850.  She is referred to as the late Johann Dyck's daughter. Johann had died earlier in 1848.<br><br>There is another Johann Dyck with a wife Helena in the census records. In Nieder-Chortitza there is such a family in 1816. However, based on information in the Grandma database, this Johann is not the ancestor of the Johann Dyck who had a daughter Agatha Dyck (1859).</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">See the notes for her father Bernhard Friesen regarding the DNA matching discussion. It appears Helena Friesen was the daughter of Bernhard Friesen and Susanna Penner. They settled at Blumenort #19 in Molotschna Colony in 1805 and Helena appears in census and immigration records until 1814. In 1815 she is in Neuendorf, married to Johann Dyck. The 1815 census says she is 18 but it does not include her age at the 1811 revision, suggesting she was not in Chortitza for that census. It seems to me that she left Molotschna in 1815 and went to Chortitza to get married.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">His ancestry is Lithuanian Mennonite according to Henry Schapansky.  I learned from H. Schapansky that his father is Hermann, his mother is Maria Klassen and his grandfather is David. Much of this has subsequently been verified by church records as noted in the source references. The birth date used here is from the Grandma Database.   He moved to Ukraine in 1818-1819.  Peter Rempel lists a Herman Schapansky arriving in Burwalde in 1819 with his wife, two sons and two daughters.  These children were with his first wife (a Doerksen). This is further substantiated by a marriage record in the German Marriages 1558-1929 online database. There is a Hermann listed in the 1847 Chortitza Householder list, but the annotations related to his wife are wrong.<br><br>Records are abundant for his children born while the family lived in Prussia; the Marcusof Marienburg Church Register is quite complete. However, records for his children after they emigrated to Ukraine are difficult to find.  Wes Reimer has published a Family Book of Johann Schapansky and Helena Hiebert that apparently has more information. Unfortunately I have been unable to obtain these records.<br><br>I have seen a date of death for son Kornelius (1807-1819) but I have not found a reference to it in the Marcusof Marienburg Church Book. I have used it here nonetheless.<br><br>Regarding Hermann's first wife, I have seen information on the web indicating her first name was Maria. The particular genealogist source isn't the most reliable.  The marriage is recorded in the Marcusof church records but her first name isn't given there. She died after 1820 when her last recorded child was born. Hermann was remarried by 1823 when the first child of his second wife was born.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Her first child was born in 1823, so she must have been born around 1803 or earlier. According to the Grandma Database it appears that she and Hermann may have had a daughter named Kornelia.<br><br>The relationship between Susanna and her parents is based on DNA analysis using DNA matches with Peter Teichroeb. The DNA match sample comprised 8 descendants of Margaretha Wiebe and Martin Dyck, through their daughter Anna Dyck. All samples were filtered using the Timber algorithm in AncestryDNA and all had a minimum longest segment of 15 cM. In all cases there were no identified genealogical relationships between the samples and Peter Teichroeb in the Grandma Database. <br><br>Immigration information indicates the Martin Dyck household moved to Molotschna in 1818. This late wave of immigrants corresponds with the Schapansky family who also immigrated in 1818-1819. However, descendants of the Dyck family must have moved to Chortitza and then to Bergthal because they were members of the Bergthal congregation. The Bergthalers and the Old Colony residents were among the first to moved to North America in the 1870s.  These physical and temporal correspondences help to confirm the likelihood that Martin Dyck and Margaretha Wiebe are actually the parents of Susanna Dyck.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Barbara Paynton Ens first told me that Jacob Loewen and Margaretha Braun are the parents of Johann.  Her father and his siblings knew Jacob and Margaretha as their great grandparents.  Margaretha was Jacob's second wife.  We know this because the Chortitza Vital Records for Neu-Osterwick in 1822 show Jacob being married to Maria Klassen.  There is a child named Peter, born in 1841, who is associated with Jacob in the Grandma Database and the mother is identified as Maria Klassen.<br><br>Initial DNA matches have linked Peter Loewen (through Faye Lowen), Johann Loewen (through me and others) and Bernhard Loewen (through Margaretha Ens, Rodney Ens and Michele Dutka).  This signals a common ancestor and the available records point to Jacob being that ancestor. <br><br>Further, more in depth, analysis that I have completed with a larger sample size sourced from the Ancestry DNA database has demonstrated this relationship to be accurate. The DNA in this study was all processed through the Timber algorithm which helps to eliminate the effects of endogamy. My method was to identify all DNA matches to my father, Peter Teichroeb, which were related to Jacob Loewen. These matches fell into five groups: (1) descendants of Peter Loewen, half brother of Johnn Loewen; (2) descendants of Bernhard Loewen, full brother of Johann Loewen; (3) descendants of Johann Loewen's wife Sara Dyck by her first husband; (4) descendants of Maria Loewen, grandmother of Peter Teichroeb; (5) all other descendants of Johann Loewen. The resulting matches (using averages for each of the five groups) were clear. The strongest matches were the descendants of Maria Loewen, with an average match of 235 cM, and these were consistent with first cousins once and twice removed. Next were the other descendants of Johann Loewen, with an average match of 123 cM, consistent with second cousins and second cousins once and twice removed. The next group were the matches to descendants of Bernhard Loewen, with an average match of 91 cM, consistent with third cousins and third cousins once and twice removed. Following this was the group of descendants of Sara Dyck, with an average match of 76 cM, consistent with half second cousins twice removed. The final group was the descendants of Peter, with an average match of 45 cM, consistent with half third cousins and half third cousins once and twice removed. This data appears to demonstrate very clearly that Johann and Bernhard were full brothers and Peter was their half brother. Jacob was the common ancestor of all three men.<br><br>Jacob's father was Michael Loewen and his mother was Maria Bueckert.  We know this because the 1801 Chortitza Colony Census shows Maria with her new husband Jacob Peters and her children Jacob Loewen (born 1800) and Maria Loewen (born 1798). The comments made by the transcribers tell us that Michael was the father of the two children.  Henry Schapansky seems to think Jacob was a son of Jacob Peters and died young.  I don't believe he is correct in this case.<br><br>The family lived in Neuendorf until about 1803. That year the village of Nieder Chortitza was established and at some point after that the family to a homestead there. By 1810 they had given up the farm and moved to Kronsthal where they were listed among the landless. In 1813 Jacob appears to have moved out, probably to work. His location is uncertiain. By October 1814 the family is landless in Neu-Osterwick. Landless usually means they are living in the village and have stopped farming. <br><br>In the May and October 1816 census records Jacob is listed as the 15 year old servant of Johann Wolf in Schoenhorst. I suspect he was a servant elsewhere in previous years but the ages don't match closely enough to be certain.<br><br>Jacob married Maria Klassen in 1822. This is recorded in the VItal Statistics for 1822. They were married in Neu-Osterwick. The EZW records indicate that son Peter was born in Neu-Osterwick.<br><br>According to Barb Paynton the family lore suggests that Margaretha was a servant in the household of Jacob Loewen and apparently she had Johann out of wedlock and his brother Bernhard in 1854 around the time of her marriage to Jacob.  This is feasible but highly uncharacteristic of normal conventions in the Mennonite community. However, both the age of Margaretha and the date of the marriage of Margaretha and Jacob are not certain. Possibly she was older than family lore indicates and possibly they were married earlier than 1854.  <br><br>Son Bernard married Anna Bergen. The marriage is supposedly recorded in the Hague, Saskatchewan church registry. I have not viewed this document.<br><br>The Grandma Database says that there was a daughter, Margaretha, who was born in 1854. She would have been a twin of Bernhard probably. The information is confusing. Bernhard is said to have been born in Tiegenhagen Molotschna, while Margaretha is said to have been born in Michaelsburg Fuerstenland. It is more likely that she died there and the information is incorrect about her birth. The EZW records are equally confusing about her birth location.<br><br>The information in the Grandma Database that Jacob and Margaretha died in a carriage accident is without any sources and therefore I am unable to prove this event occurred.<br><br>The Grandma Database has two Jacob Loewens who I believe are the same individual, #198119 and #188375.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">He is specified as the father of both sons Johann and Heinrich on their death certificates. Only Heinrich's death certificate provides the name of his mother, Judith Rempel. Dates related to Heinrich are from his death certificate. <br><br>EZW records indicate that he was born in Chortitza village. Therefore the family moved there by 1832.<br><br>It is interesting that in a letter I received in the 1990s Ben Fast recalled that his grandfather, Johann Fast (1852-1920), had two brothers, Heinrich and Jacob. He knew that Heinrich never married and that Jacob's son, also a Jacob, came to Canada and lived in Winnipeg at some point. Ben travelled to Winnipeg to meet him. Heinrich is shown in a picture with his brother's (Johann's) sons. It took years to piece together the family genealogy and when eveidence was finally found it corresponded with what Ben had told me.<br><br>The Einwandererzentralstelle Collection connects the third son, Jacob, to his parents, Johann Fast and Judith Rempel. It provides the birth and death information used here. This record also connects Jacob to his wife Gertrude Dyck, and to his son Jacob and daughter-in-law Natalie Toews. Jacob's family came to Canada in 1947 but it appears he died prior to that.<br><br>We know from records in the Berlin Document Archives that Jacob and his family were patriated to German-controlled territory around 1943 and naturalized to become German citizens. Son Jacob came to Canada in 1947 and was in Steinbach in 1948 when his daughter Anna was born and then died as an infant (Find A Grave #131413396). His wife was Natalie Toews. Anna's grave marker confirms her mother was Natalie. Jacob later moved to Ontario.<br><br>The Chortitza Family Registers provide the name of a daughter of Johann and Judith, Maria (1858). Maria's father in law, Heinrich Heese, a well known Mennonite educator, was the founder of the Chortitza Zentralschule.<br><br>The Grandma Database gives the name of another daughter, Aganetha (1862). I do not have information to substantiate this. It appears that Aganetha was connected to the WW2 German Naturalization program that the Nazis carried out during their invasion of Ukraine and Russia because source citations for her are from the EZW data.<br><br>The story of his son, Jacob, is fascinating. Some of this information is from the Grandma Database, which takes the data from the Berlin Archives, and some is from my own research. Jacob had four sons with his second wife, Gertrude. They lived in various locations but it seems they stayed primarily in the Chortitza Colony area. Two sons, Wilhelm and Heinrich, were taken by the Russian secret police in the 1930s, and never seen again. Then in 1943 the German army occupied the area where they lived. Jacob was immediately drafted by the German military. I have little doubt that his brother, Johann, was similarly drafted. When the German army withdrew from Ukraine they implemented a policy of patriating German speaking inhabitants and these people were naturalized when they arrived in Germany. Among them was Jacob and his wife and children, his brother and his parents. Father Jacob died while in Germany and the rest of the family left for Canada in 1947. Ben Fast met Jacob in Winnipeg at one point. It is clear that Jacob and his family were in Winnipeg in 1948 when his daughter, Anna, was born. Jacob and his family later moved to Niagara-on-the-Lake. Jacob became a Canadian citizen in 1954. <br><br>Sam Steiner, in his blog on ontariomennonitehistory.org,  picks up the story: "In 1999 Jacob Fast of St. Catharines, Ontario was charged with war crimes and lying about his past when he immigrated to Canada in 1947. The Canadian government alleged that his failure to divulge his involvement as a collaborator with occupying German forces (namely as part of the auxiliary police) and his German citizenship warranted revocation of  his Canadian citizenship. On October 3, 2003, the Federal Court ruled that Mr. Fast had obtained his Canadian citizenship by deceit, in that he had failed to reveal his German citizenship when applying to come to Canada in 1947. The court also found that Mr. Fast had collaborated with the German Security Police responsible for enforcing the racial policies of the German Reich, but on the balance of probabilities had not been asked this question directly and therefore, had not lied nor concealed his wartime activities. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration recommended to the Governor in Council that Fast's citizenship be revoked. The Government of Canada announced the revocation on May 24, 2007. Jacob Fast died three weeks later on June 11 at the age of 97.".</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Little is known at the moment about Cornelius. We know Maria's father is a Cornelius and that is about it. There is a Cornelius Krahn listed as a householder in the Chortitza Householder lists of 1847 and 1859.  The person in the 1847 list was born around 1797 according to the annotations, and was considerably older than the Cornelius who was husband to Helena; it could be his father because the Rosenthal location matches other family information and the elder Cornelius had a son Cornelius of unspecified birth date.  However, the elder Cornelius married a woman born in 1817, making this relationship potentially unworkable unless Cornelius was born prior to 1817 to a different mother.<br><br>There is also a Cornelius Krahn listed in the 1863 Chortitza Signature List.  He is listed as a resident of Schoeneberg.  Cornelius is not in the 1863 Grain List and therefore we don't know if he was a landowner, although the indication is that he was not.  The location indicates this is probably is a different Cornelius.<br><br>Information about his daughter Helena is in the Choritza Family Register, which states that she was born in Rosenthal. This supports the assertion that the family lived in Rosenthal when Maria was born. Helena Redekop's parents appear to have lived in Rosenthal the entire time they were in Ukraine, based on census records, vital statistics (for their marriage) and other records. Helena married both husbands in Rosenthal based on the Johann Jacob Rempel Family Book.<br><br>I suspect that Cornelius Krahn #668818 is the same person as Cornelius Krahn #174331. The primary rationale is that both appear to originate in Rosenthal (Chortitza Settlement); as late as 1847 there was only one Krahn family living in that village - Cornelius #189693. According to GMOL, #668818 is the son of Cornelius #189693 (b. 1797) who married Anna Rempel (b. 1817). I further suspect that Anna was a second wife, based on the age difference, and not the mother of #668818. The source notes in Grandma for Cornelius #668818 attribute the information to Eleanor Neufeld Schartner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">In a conversation with my father, Peter Teichroeb, Amy Ens Loewen confirmed that Heinrich Epp (1826) was a brother to Jacob Epp (1823), who is listed in the Jacob Epp - Elizabeth Ens Genealogy as a son of Peter Epp and Helena Goertzen/Goossen.  Amy's knowledge is based on first hand information that her parents were third cousins. This is the third cousin lineage. Peter Epp had two sons (among others), Jacob (1823) and Heinrich (1826). Jacob (1823) had a son Jacob whose daughter Helena married a Gerhard Ens and their son Jacob Ens married a Helena Fast. Heinrich (1826) had a son Heinrich whose daughter Helena married a Jacob Fast and their daughter Helena Fast was the woman Jacob Ens married. Jacob Ens and Helena Fast were the parents of Amy Ens.<br><br>Heinrich was probably born in Chortitza. We know this from the information contained in the certificate of origin for David Epp (1858) found in the Epp-Ens genealogy material assembled by Cornelius Epp and Orval Ens. David Epp was a son of Jacob Epp (1823).   <br><br>Heinrich and Helena moved to Fuerstenland. The date of the move is unknown, but the baptism record contains the record of two daughters baptisms: Margaretha in 1889 in Georgsthal and Susanna in 1887 in Rosenbach. In 1887 the family was living in Michaelsburg.<br><br>According to the Peter and Anna Epp genealogy material, Heinrich and Helena emigrated to Canada in 1892, a year ahead of their son Peter. They settled in Saskatchewan in 1893, four miles north of where Waldheim is now. Apparently they had sold their land in Ukraine rather than simply abandoning it.  Two sons and a daughter and their households had arrived in the Territories ahead of them.  One of the sons was Heinrich.  He and his wife, Margaretha Rempel, were the first members of the family to leave Ukraine to emigrate to Canada. The marriage date for Heinrich and Helena is from the Grandma Database. There are Heinrich Epps mentioned in the 1863 Chortitza Grain and Signature Lists in Chortitza and Kronsweide.  Possibly he is one of these, although it isn't clear which.  Heinrich is buried in a cemetery in Waldheim, Saskatchewan.<br><br>The Grandma Database tells us that Heinrich had a brother named David and suggests that he may have had another brother named Peter; I am unsure of the accuracy of these assertions because the notes are a bit muddled in their wording.  However, families recycled names and often used the names of uncles and aunts, and consequently a brother named Peter is a likelihood.  Similarly other sons were often given the names of uncles, and Jacob had a son David who might have been named for an uncle David.<br><br>Heinrich's son David Epp was a minister in Laird, Saskatchewan. Comments from the Grandma Database say "David Epp prided himself in being one of a small committee who planned and dealt with Government bureaucracy to establish the school district of Carmen. He recalls that due to a lack of educated Mennonites the first teacher was an American."<br><br>Daughter Maria Epp was at least 43 years old when she married Gerhard Hoeppner. He had one teen-age son from his previous marriage. After Gerhard's death Maria stayed in their home for about a year, then lived with her nephew Henry D. Epp for about a year. She then moved to Laird SK where she and here sister Katherine lived together. Katharine never married.<br><br>Daughter Helena Epp was born on 7 July 1851.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He settled in Reinland Manitoba with his wife and family in 1875.  The Bergthal Gemeinde Buch lists him in the passenger list for the S.S. Canadian No. 32, which landed in Quebec on 19 July 1875.  His wife was Helena in the passenger list, aged about 4 years older than Peter. The Mennonite passengers on this ship were from the Chortitza settlement. The Reinlander Gemeinde Buch gives his first wife's name as Helena Friesen. The Grandma Database lists his second wife as Helena Hiebert.  It is Helena Hiebert that came to Canada.  Catharina is listed on the passenger list as age 13, spinster.  Peter also appears with his daughter Helena (Sawatzky)'s family in the 1901 census, living in Rosthern. That census record is dated April 6-9.  This is where I obtained his birth date.  However Peter is also in the Manitoba census living with his daughter Katharina (Dyck)'s family. In that census Peter is found in the District of Lisgar, sub district Rhineland #56, F-11 page 8 line 38 (village of Gretna/Plum Coulee).  The enumeration was on 17 April 1901.  Peter does not appear in the 1881 census, according to the Bergthal Gemeinde Buch (and I can't find him in the census either).<br><br>The 1901 Canada Census shows an immigration to Canada in 1881.  In the 1880 U.S. Federal Census he is listed in Cass County, Dakota Territory, where his age is incorrectly given as 40. Generally the family members are consistent in the U.S. Census although there are a few errors. His residence in the U.S. during this period explains his absence from the 1881 Canadian census. In the 1891 and 1901 Canada censuses he is listed in the Regional Municipality of Rhineland, Manitoba.   The date of death is given in the Grandma Database; if correct, he died in Saskatchewan.  If this is true then his daughter Katharina moved there after 1901. She does not appear in any census until 1916 when she is married to Klaas Dyck and living in Saskatchewan. <br><br>I picked up the marriage date to Helena Friesen from the Grandma Database.<br><br>I have seen sources who record a middle initial of D.  This would generally represent either his father's first name or the first letter of his mother's maiden name. <br><br>I have seen information online indicating his father was Jacob Peters and his mother was Elisabeth Friesen. I can find no information to substantiate this. However, this data does not correspond well to the middle initial "D". One association I found to a Jacob Peters is clearly incorrect because that Jacob had a son Peter born in 1846. <br><br>I have seen some family records where a Maria is listed. She can not be a daughter of Peter (1837-1905) because he already has a younger daughter named Maria.  Possibly she is a sibling of Peter or of his wife Helena.  <br><br>The Grandma Database is fairly clear that Helena Hiebert is the second wife of Peter Peters and the mother of Agatha, the last of Peter's children.  She doesn't appear with Peter in the 1901 census. Peter is listed living with daughter Katharina. Helena appears to be the woman listed with Johann Wolf and his family. Apparently she was blind and crippled and possibly needed more care than Peter or his daughter's family could manage. There is a Mennonitische Rundschau article posted on 13 April 1910 supplying the information about here death at age 78 and her poor health.<br><br>I am uncertain of the the precision of the death information I have used for Helena, although the year is accurate.<br><br>I note that the Bergthal Gemeinde Buch also lists an 18 year old "spinster" named Maria; clearly she isn't one of Peter's children since he has a younger daughter Maria; I surmise that this is one of Helena Hiebert's children from an earlier marriage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">The Reinlander Gemeinde Buch gives us the information about the marriage of Peter and Helena. This appears in the entry related to their daughter Anna. It seems that Helena died shortly after Anna was born and Peter gave the infant to another family for a brief period. He took the child back before he emigrated from Ukraine to Canada.<br><br>The specific date of death is taken from the Grandma Database and I have not verified it. Similarly the marriage date for Peter and Helena has not been verified.<br><br>A Helena settled in Reinland Manitoba with her husband and her family in 1875. The Bergthal Gemeinde Buch lists her in the passenger list for the S.S. Canadian No. 32, which landed in Quebec on 19 July 1875.  This must be Helena Hiebert based on the Grandma Database which tells us that after Helena Friesen died in 1874 Peter remarried. Helena Hiebert appears in the 1901 census, living with the Johann Wolf family while Peter is living with daughter Katharina. Helena Friesen's daughter Anna, born in 1872, had foster parents Abraham Hiebert (1840 - 1915) and Helena Wiens (1843 - 1893), according to the Reinlander Gemeinde Buch. It seems that Peter gave that infant daughter up for adoption after Helena Friesen died. This Abraham Hiebert is the son of Daniel Hiebert. I have found no relationship between him and Peter's second wife Helena Hiebert. Anna later reappears with the family in the passenger list for their emigration to Canada.</p>
