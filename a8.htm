<p style="margin-left:1in">Karin Teichroeb Fast has completed research that concluded Michael Teichroeb (abt 1741), Johann Teichroeb (abt 1744), Peter Michael Teichroeb (abt 1751) and Abraham Teichroeb (bef 1740) were brothers. This is based on archival records in Berlin, Poland and Ukraine. The Molotschna Census for 1835 provides the name of Peter's father, Michael.<br><br>Geographic data:<br><br>Michael (abt 1741) appears in the 1776 census in Kalthof. His son Peter (1761) appears in the Heubuden baptism records in 1781, living in Krebsfeld.<br><br>Peter (abt 1751) was from Kalthof according to Unruh. His son Heinrich (1777) appears in the Heubuden baptism records in 1795, living in Kalthof. The Heubuden baptism records also list a Peter from Schoenau being baptized in 1774 - this could be Peter (1751). There are no Teichroebs listed in Schoenau in the 1772 and 1776 census records.<br><br>Johann (abt 1744) appears in the 1772 and 1776 census records in Krebsfeld.<br><br>Abraham (bef 1740) appears in the 1772 and 1776 census records in Krebsfeld.<br><br>Is it possible that the family was originally from Schoenau and the brothers moved to Krebsfeld and Kalthof?</p>

<p style="margin-left:0.5in"><b>132.  Jacob Wolf</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#213"><sup>213</sup></a> son of <a href="a9.htm#i1169885"><b>Gottfried Wolf</a>,</b> was born in 1753 in Heubuden, Marienburg Region, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was baptized 18 July 1773 in Heubuden, Marienburg Region, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and died in 1790 in Schoenhorst, Chortitza, Ukraine. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Jacob was a Flemish Mennonite from Heubuden and was a member of the Heubuden Gemeinde.  He was baptized in 1773 and married to Justina Harder in 1776. He appears in the 1776 census in Willenbruchs Huben with his wife. His financial situation is given as 'schlecht', meaning not very well off, but with sufficient earnings to make ends meet. His first two children, Johann and Justina, were born in Heubuden and registered in the Heubuden Church Book.  His third son, David, isn't in the Heubuden Church Book.  His fourth son, Peter, is registered and the family was living in Gross Lesewitz or vicinity at that time.  <br><br>Glenn H. Penner's research has concluded that Jacob emigrated to Ukraine in the 1789 wave of migration. He had a homestead in Schoenhorst and his elder son Johann was the head of the household there from 1795, or earlier.  Jacob died between the period around the birth of his son, Jacob, in 1789 and 1791 (the birth of his wife's first son with David Isbrecht is on 11 November 1792).<br><br>There is an entry in the Grandma Database to the effect that Jacob's father was probably a Gottfried Wolf from Elbing. This is possible, although Gottfried appears in the Elbing Region in the 1772 (Krebsfelde) census while Jacob appears in the Marienburg Region (Heubuden), being baptized in 1773. Heubuden is 18 km southwest of Krebsfelde.<br><br>In the 1772 Census Gottfried Wolf is listed as a Mennonite in Krebsfelde with a wife, one son over the age of 10 and one daughter under the age of 10. The daughter corresponds to Maria, whose mother was Gottfried's second wife, Margaretha Penner (they were married in 1763 according to the Grandma Database). There is no way to know if the son in the record relates to Jacob, although Jacob would likely be living at the family home in 1772. The anomaly is that Jacob was baptized in Heubuden the year after the census. In the 1776 Census Gottfried is still living in Krebsfelde. One possible explanation is that Jacob moved to Heubuden in 1773 where he was baptized and married. His future wife, Justina Harder, was baptized in Heubuden the following year. <br><br>Bruce Fast claims that Jacob's father was a Johann Wolf. If Johann is a correct ancestor he possibly originates in Heubuden where his son's baptism is recorded.  Further research is needed to substantiate his origin and the accuracy of his ancestral relationship. Bruces's family tree is no longer available online but he discusses the history of the Wolf family and I quote him here: Johann is "...possibly a descendant of the De Wolff family, a Mennonite family of Amsterdam, found there around 1595 - 1840. They were members of the Flemish congregation and from 1664 sided with the Lamists. Some de Wolffs were deacons of this church. The de Wolffs originally were Mennonites from Antwerp, Belgium, who in the 1580's fled to Cologne, Germany, and soon after moved to Amsterdam. Maeyken de Wolf (1586-1635) was married to the Dutch poet Joost van den Vondel; her brother Hans de Wolf (d. before 1625) was married to Joost's sister Clementia van den Vondel. In Amsterdam the de Wolffs were businessmen, particularly silk merchants. Among them were Hans de Wolff (1614 - about 1670), who was married first to Cornelia Block and in 1643 to Agnes Block (he left a considerable legacy to the Lamist congregation for the founding of an orphanage), and Pieter de Wolff (1646-1691), who was married to Clementia van der Vecht, a very wealthy silk merchant with great interest in the church. A side branch of this family lived at Haarlem in the 17th and 18th centuries. This branch was more conservative than the Amsterdam de Wolffs. Oliviere Wolff, from 1653 a trustee of the Haarlem Flemish Mennonite orphanage as well as a deacon, represented the Haarlem Flemish congregation at the conservative conference (the Leidsche Synode) held at Leiden in 1660.".<br><br>Although this is interesting Netherlandic history for the Wolf name, there are no people named Wolf in existing early records of Mennonites in Danzig, whether early census records or the Danzig Church Book. Further, there are no people named Wolf in the 1727 Census or the 1789 Census. The 1776 Census, a specifically Mennonite census, contains only Jacob and Gottfried. The 1772 Census contains many people named Wolf but inevitably most are not Mennonites. Gottfried is listed in that census, in Krebsfelde.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">His son is listed as Abraham Abraham, implying that he is the son of Abraham, as I have recorded here. There is an Abraham in the Tragheimerweide Church Book with daughters born around the same time as son Abraham.  In the Grandma database there are entries for Abraham Abrams #204253, and #311095. I believe these are the same person. We see his three daughters in the baptism records in Reehof. Son Abraham was born earlier and would have likely been baptised before the earliest records for the Tragheimerweide Church Book. I have also seen a Sara Abrams (1756-1798) who is often associated with Abraham. If this is correct it pushes back Abraham's year of birth back to around 1735, in line with the year his wife was born.<br><br>The 1776 Prussian Census lists him with a wife and five daughters but no son. This gap may mean his son Abraham was working elsewhere, it could be the result of an error or it could mean the two Abrahams are not connected.<br><br>In the Tragheimerweide Church Book I found a widow Abrams who died at Zieglershuben in 1816 at the age of 78.

However, H. Schapansky says he was in Neustadterwald in 1776 with two sons, and was part of the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde.  Tiegenhagen was a Flemish Gemeinde, originally part of the Grosses Werder Gemeinde and later one of the four sections into which it was divided in 1735. <br><br>His year of birth is based on the birth of his oldest son Nicholas and Schapansky gives us his approximate year of death.<br><br>Some online records confuse Johann and his son (also Johann) and their children as well as Anna Andres.

They were Lithuanian Mennonites, and their ancestors had settled in Polish Lithuania in the early 1700s. The son, David, was born around 1751, and from this we can assume the father, David was born at least 20 years earlier, or before 1731. The Thiensdorf Baptism Record lists one of the elder David's sons, Cornelius, who was baptized in 1781. He is listed as a surviving son of David, so we know David had died prior to 1781. The family lived in the village of Hohenwald at the time. It is difficult to find a source for his daughter Anna. The Thiensdorf Nachfahrenliste provides the information for sons Herman and Cornelius.<br><br>The Grandma database mentions an oral history of the Schapansky family, with which I was previously unfamiliar. According to this history, David's father was a Catholic farm labourer working for a Mennonite farmer in Lithuania. He was baptized a Mennonite and married a Mennonite woman. When the Mennonite family moved to Thiensdorf in 1730 he was with them and acquired a farm there. The challenge in validating such stories is to provide historical facts to support this general outline. We know that, whatever the circumstances, the family did live in Thiensdorf, as indicated above in reference to baptism records. Fortunately come concrete historical information has been discovered and it is somewhat aligned with this story, although only in the most general way.<br><br>Glenn Penner has identified the earliest known Mennonite Schapansky ancestors. There was a Matthies Schapansky living in Elbing in the mid-seventeenth century. He was a member of the Lutheran Church. In 1670 he had a son whom he named Matthies. In 1696 the son married a Mennonite woman named Catharina Jantzen in a Lutheran church ceremony. Catharina was the daughter of a Mennonite, Claas Jantzen of Wengeln in the Marienburg Klein Werder. Matthies and Catharina had six children, all christened Lutheran. <br><br>Around 1714 Matthies and Catharina moved to Lithuania. At this time settlement in the Memel Lowlands was being actively encouraged in a program to restore the region following a devastating plague that struck the Baltic Coast in 1709. The population and the economy had been decimated. Generous terms were offered to attract settlers. In response, a major Mennonite settlement was established there. Whether Matthies and Catharina were part of the Mennonite group at the outset is unknown. <br><br>By 1722 all six children had become Mennonites and members of the Frisian congregation. Matthies subsequently appealed for permission to convert from Lutheranism to the Mennonite Church. In those days, the conversion of Lutherans was strictly controlled. An investigation was conducted by the authorities, and approval was granted.<br><br>The oldest child, Gottfried, born in 1696 was farming independently by 1722.<br><br>In 1723 five Mennonite men were seized by a Prussian press gang and held for military service. The Mennonite community protested, and the men were freed. That might have been the end of the matter, but the Mennonite group was not yet satisfied. They threatened to cancel their settlement contracts with the crown unless they were given a guarantee to respect their exemption from military service. The king, Friedrich Wilhelm I, objecting to this brinksmanship, responded in 1724 with a formal expulsion order. The result was that in 1724 some 115-120 Mennonite families were forced to leave Lithuania, including the families of Matthies Schapansky and Gottfried Schapansky. According to surviving records, Matthias headed west to the Marienburg Klein Werder region and Gottfried headed to Thiensdorf, near Elbing. <br><br>A son, David, was born there sometime around 1731. All the available evidence indicates that he must have been a son of Gottfried.<br><br>David married Anna Pauls. One of their sons, David (ca 1751), emigrated to Ukraine, arriving in the Chortitza settlement in 1795. H. Schapansky has written about him and I believe he appears in the Plauschwarren Marriage List. He was a Lithuanian Mennonite and he lived in Schonweide, Chortitza in 1795.  He was an uncle to Hermann (1785). <br><br>One of their grandsons, Herman (1785), a son of Herman Schapansky (1754-1824), emigrated to Ukraine in 1819 and settled in the village of Burwalde in the Chortitza Settlement. People living in North America today who can trace their ancestry to a Mennonite Schapansky from Ukraine are likely to be descendants of David Schapansky and Anna Pauls. <br><br>Horst Penner elaborates on the origin of the family name in great detail in his research. I relate his work here because it is interesting. However, it is doubtful that the relationship he suggests between the Polish nobility and the Mennonites is true. <br><br>He says that in 1293 land and title was conferred on a fellow named Dietrich in a town near Roggenhausen, by Meinhard Von Overfurt.  The town became known as Dietrichsdorf.  Dietrichsdorf is long gone and Roggenhausen is now the city of Rogozno, located about 145 km southwest of Graudenz. <br><br>In 1510 a nobleman named Jacob of Dietrichsdorf-Szchepanke was listed as a landowner in Prussia. <br><br>Years later, in Graudenz on 25 August 1593, King Sigismund III confirmed entitlement to the land and title possessed by a man named Dietrichsdorf "also know as Sczepanski". Penner mentions a grave marker in a Catholic graveyard in Graudenz with the name of Jacob Szcepanski inscribed on it. In fact the family has left behind elaborate statues, family epitaphs and heraldic crests along with the tombstones of many family members in the All Saints Chapel of the Carthusian Monastery in Kartuzy.<br><br>The story continues, partially as outlined by Penner and supplemented with abundant public information available on the Internet. Jacob Sczepanski (presumably the same man) held the position of Governor of Graudenz from 1616 until his death in 1630. Jacob was born around 1556 and was the son of Jan. He was a high ranking noble and well respected Knight. After his death his wife, Susanna Genger, of Austrian nobility, took over his responsibilities, a role that she later passed on to her grandson Gabriel Ferdinand. She first came into contact with the Mennonites in 1632, shortly after her husband's death.  During her tenure she renewed a 40 year contract with the Mennonites, represented by Caspar Janzen, Abraham Meinerth and Heinrich Conradts. She died about 1650 in Graudenz. <br><br>Gabriel Ferdinand Sczepanski took over his grandmother's responsibilities as Starost of Graudenz in 1645. He was the son of Zygmund Ferdinand Sczepanski. Zygmund had broad administrative responsibilities throughout the kingdom but he never governed Graudenz. Zygmund died around 1659. Years passed before the Schapansky name turned up again in historical events.  <br><br>In the intervening years Penner says that the two Swedish wars (1655-1660 and 1700-1721) left the population impoverished, including the Schapanskys that had overseen the town of Graudenz for decades. These Schapanskys moved to the suburbs of Elbing, where a substantial Mennonite community was already established. From there, Penner says, they joined the Mennonite settlement movement which had begun as early as 1711, and headed for the Memel Lowlands in Prussian Lithuania. The implication in Penner's account is that these Schapanskys were the descendents of Gabriel Ferdinand, who died in 1690. This is a tempting relationship to accept but there is not much concrete evidence to support it. <br><br>The available genealogical information available, some of which is quite detailed and appears to be valid, describes a long aristocratic lineage. From this it appears that Jacob had only one son, Zygmund. Zygmund also had only one son, Gabriel, one daughter, Regina, and six children who died as infants. Gabriel's parents, paternal grandparents and paternal great grandparents are all buried in the All Saints Chapel. The location of Gabriel's grave is unknown. <br><br>Gabriel was a colorful figure. On his genealogy website Peter Kuty says that Gabriel was a  Florentine Knight of the Order of St. Stefan and in 1645 assumed the duties of Sheriff of Graudenz. Gabriel was married twice but neither marriage produced children. His first marriage was in 1649 to Teresa Elzbieta of Konopat, daughter of Jakub Octawian, Governor of Elbing. This marriage ended in 1652 when it was discovered that Gabriel was in a polygamous marriage to Anna Barbara Scharpffenberg. The records are silent on the duration of the marriage to Anna. However, he also had a relationship with a woman named Katarzyna, of whom little is known except that she had a son with Gabriel sometime after 1650. This son was Gabriel Dominik Szczepanski (ca 1650). <br><br>There is nothing further known about this line of the Szczepanski family. If the information outlined above is accurate then there certainly does not appear to be a genealogical linkage between this family and the Mennonite Schapanskys.<br><br>There is a small village named Szczepanki just outside Graudenz. Often people adopted the name of their locale as a surname. Therefore the Sczepanski name found among Mennonites could easily originate with a peasant farmer.<br><br>Graudenz is now the city of Grudziadz.  The town was established in 1291.  Prior to this it had already been established as a base from which the Catholic Church carried out its papal mandate to Christianize Prussia, first under a Bishop Christian, as early as 1218, and later under the command of the Teutonic Knights, an offshoot of the Templars.  Until 1466 the town was under the control of the Teutonic Knights.  In 1466 the region came under the direct control of the Polish crown and became the seat of the Prussian Parliament. Graudenz was a political and economic center for many years.  During the Swedish wars in the 17th century the city was occupied first by German defensive troops, as early as 1629, and then overrun by Swedish troops who occupied the city until 1659.  It was then liberated by the Polish army.  However, during the years of military activity most of the city was destroyed, with only the castle, cathedral and a few houses surviving.  Toward the end of the 18th century the lingering wars abated and Graudenz was able to rebuild.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">In the 1776 Prussian Census Heinrich is listed in Neustaedterwald with 3 sons. He was a member of the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde.  He migrated from Prussia to Chortitza in 1789 according to information from Peter Rempel. However, he is not listed in the group of 228 orignal settlers. He is not listed in the 1793 Chortitza Colony Heads of Household List or in later documents; he must have died by then.  He had been living in Neuenburg because the 1802 Homestead List published by Unruh tells us his widow died before 1802 and her property went to her daughter's husband Cornelius Willms.<br><br>Heinrich had a first wife whose identity is unknown. She was the mother of Michael Loewen as well as brothers Abraham and Jacob. <br><br>Based on information presented by H. Schapansky and the Grandma Database it seems that Heinrich had a second wife, Anna, who was the mother of Dirk Loewen. Dirk was born thirteen years after his brother Michael. Apparently Anna first married Dirk Rempel and then Aron Peters before she married Heinrich Loewen. It has been suggested that Anna may have had three children with Dirk Rempel: Nicholas (1774-1806), Anna (1766), and Helena (1769). However, this is speculative because there are other children of Dirk Rempel who were born as early as 1748. Based on the obvious age gap between the first of Dirk's children (born in 1748) and the second, (born in 1763), it seems likely that these three children along with Catharina (1763) and Gerhard (1768) belonged to Anna. Anna immigrated to Chortitza in 1789.<br><br>It appears that Heinrich died before the family arrived in Chortitza, because he is not listed among the first settlers. His second wife, Anna, had been married to a Rempel previously, and her daughter Helena moved to the village of Einlage in 1789 with her husband Cornelius Willms. They had no children at this time but their household in the First Setters list shows four adults and two children. This household would have included Helena and Cornelius, Helena's mother Anna, her brother Claas Rempel (b. 1773), Anna's son with Heinrich Loewen, Dirk (b. 1784), and Heinrich's son from his first marriage, Michael (b. 1771). Heinrich's elder sons Jacob and Abraham emigrated separately with their families. Michael would have been listed among the adults while Dirk and Claas were listed as the two children. The Loan list for 1789-1793 confirms this analysis, giving counts of three adults and three children, where Michael is counted as a child. In 1795 the census shows that Claas is still living with his sister Helena. The 1802 homestead list indicates that title of the property passed from Anna to Cornelius, meaning that, even though he is listed as the head of the household, the homestead belonged to Anna (and Heinrich).<br><br>Stumpp lists Dirk (Dietrich) as a child born in 1784 from Neustadterwald who emigrated in 1789 and lived at Einlage. This is the best evidence we have that the family actually emigrated as part of the earliest group of settlers.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Daniel came to Ukraine in 1789 and is listed among the original 228 households to settle in Chortitza. He was destined for Neuendorf. He came with a household of two adults and four children. It is unclear who these individuals were but in the 1795 Census we see his children Jacob, Maria and Anna at Neuendorf #36. <br><br>There is some information, on the internet and on the Grandma Database, saying that the settler was Jacob Bueckert. The available evidence does not support this view. According to Glenn Penner's work on the original migration to Ukraine in 1788-1789 Jacob is one of the people frequently mentioned as an original settler but for whom there is no record that he came to Ukraine. The general supposition is that he died before 1795 because the children are alone in the 1795 census at Neuendorf #36. It is more likely that the individual was Daniel Bueckert. <br><br>Unruh shows a record for 1802 in which it says Jacob Bueckert died and the farm was given to Michael Loewen. Michael in turn died and the farm was left to his widow and her new husband, Jacob Peters. I think it is more likely that after Daniel died the farm was in the hands of the elder son, Jacob Bueckert, who married Barbara Conrad in 1802 and is not found in the census. Michael Loewen had married Maria Bueckert by 1797. Therefore the Daniel Bueckert farm stayed in the hands of the family. I think the reason the farm passed to Michael Loewen instead of remaining with Jacob Bueckert is because Jacob was still unmarried and living with Loewen and wife Maria in 1797. The headcount in the 1797 supports this. There are two males and one female in the household but Michael and Maria had no children at this time. It follows that the other male is Maria's brother Jacob.<br><br>Barbara Conrad had married Johann Hiebert in 1797 and received the homestead of her father Abraham Conrad. This homestead was in Einlage, where earlier, in 1795, Barbara and her siblings were living without parents at Einlage #6. We next find Barbara with her second husband, Jacob Bueckert, in Nieder Chortitza in the 1806 Census, having taken over the homestead of Johann Wiebe. By 1807 Jacob Bueckert has married Helena Froese and they are found in the 1807 Census at Nieder Chortitza #3. <br><br>Supporting the conclusion that the original settler is Daniel Bueckert and not Jacob is the document listing funds loaned to settlers. There we see Daniel Bueckert as an original settler, loaned money as early as 1788. This entry shows that the money is now loaned to his children, one man and two women. These would be the three children that we find in the 1795 Census. It follows that Daniel died after arriving in Chortitza but it is unclear exactly when. The 1802 homestead list indicates that the homestead had passed twice, once to daughter Maria's husband Michael Loewen, and then to her husband Jacob Peters. In addition in 1806 we see that Daniel's homestead in Nieder Chortitza had passed to Jacob Peters. More research is needed to properly understand the events that occurred here and why Daniel is associated with homesteads in two villages.<br><br>Marie Bueckert and Jacob Peters are living at Nieder Chortitza #25 in the 1807 and 1808 censuses.<br><br>Identification of Daniel's specific children was done by matching the ages reported in Benjamin Unruh's book with birth records for the Heubuden Church. This is probably a reasonable estimate but it seems there are at least two Bueckert families being recorded in these church records. I noted an Anna Bueckert born 18 December 1778, six or seven months after Maria was born. Then another Anna was born in 1780.<br><br>The Grandma Database indicates a wife named Elisabeth associated with Jacob.  There are no records to substantiate this. There is another Jacob Bueckert who married an Elisabeth Neufeld and the confusion between Jacob and Daniel may have been compounded by connecting Elisabeth to both Jacobs.<br><br>The Grandma Database has a reference to a Daniel Buckert who had a daughter named Catarina. She was baptised in Tiegenhagen in 1789. This record implies Daniel is deceased at the time but I am not convinced this is accurate. The record says he lived in Poppau and belonged to the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde. This is possible if he moved closer to Danzig in order to qualify for emigration, something that many rural Mennonites did at the time. See Grandma #748233.<br><br>The record of original settlers shows Daniel Bueckert had a household with two adults and four children. Daniel and the identified three children fall short of this number. Possibly Catarina was with the group and was married before the 1795 census. Further, there may have been a wife of Daniel who died in the same time frame.<br><br>The Heubuden Church records indicate his son Jacob was born on 8 May 1776. Daughter Anna's year of birth is 1780, as evidenced by an entry in the Heubuden Church records. I have retained the references to the Heubuden records although I am not entirely convinced they apply to these children. In all cases I have used estimated birth years based on Chortitza census data.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Isaac's birth year is based on Rempel's book and his death year is based on Stumpp. Rempel says he was from the Marienburg Region. Henry Schapansky says he lived in Neuteicherfeld for some time. <br><br>I am using Rempel for the birth years of the children. Schapansky indicated that daughter Katharina died young but she appears in Rempel and the census records for 1806. There also seems to be something amiss with Anna. Schapansky indicates she was born in 1787 and died in 1796. However, Rempel and the 1806 census list her as being born in 1795. I think that there was a daughter named Anna who died as a child and then a new daughter was given the same name in 1795.<br><br>His family appears in the Kronsgarten Census for 1816, four years after his death (the specific date of death is uncertain although there is a reference to him on Geni saying he died on 12 October. There is no source reference for this). According to that census, the family arrived in 1804 from abroad. In 1814 the family moved to Kronsgarten from the city of Jakaterinoslav and took over an existing farm and received a tax exemption until 1816. Note that this differs from an entry in Rempel (page 20) mentioning an Isaac Klassen that took over a farm in Kronsgarten in 1806. The 1806 Kronsgarten census matches Rempel. I think there is something wrong with the notation because it seems odd that the family would move back and forth from Kronsgarten to Jakaterinoslav in this way.<br><br>Rempel also mentions that in 1805 when the family moved to the Chortitza area they had with them Michael Peters (born 1722). This must be Katherina's father, who was referenced by Henry Schapansky.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">There is a David Falck listed in the Plauschwarren Church as having been baptized in 1777.  This is in the Lithuanian Settlement in East Prussia.  The father's name in the baptism record was David Falcke.  The baptized individual could be David Falk b. 1759. H. Schapansky confirms this.  He migrated to Ukraine in 1793 and lived in Schoenwiese in 1795 and 1801 through 1816.  The date of his marriage to Maria Bartsch is estimated based on the census data and the ages of children; the location is based on the census data.<br><br>David's first wife, Sara Martens, was baptized on 27 May 1776 at Plauschwarren, according to the Grandma Database. The Grandma Database indicates she had a child born around 1800 who died in infancy. I find no sources to substantiate this.<br><br>Based on the ages of David's children with his second wife, his first wife, Maria Bartsch, must have died around 1806.  Based on the marriage date of his second wife to her second husband, David must have died before 1827.<br><br>Glenn Penner says that in the 1770s there were two Falk families in the Lithuanian congregation. One was David's family and the other was that of Johann Falk who apparently had no known children. Penner believes that David is the ancestor of all Mennonite Falks.<br><br>His son David Falk was in Schonwiese in 1814. The 1858 Schonwiese Census states that Abraham Falk (born about 1817) was the son of David Falk (born about 1780) by his first wife.  This would suggest that David married a second time after his first wife died.  I don't find any information to support two marriages. David wife was Jetchen Martens. This is the Dutch form of the name. Other sources have her name as Ettin (B. Unruh), Henrietta (H. Schapansky) or Goettchen (K. Peters). I have read that she was born in Kronsweide but this probably is incorrect because her father did not settle in Chortitza until 1790-1793, after her birth.  Further, I have found no reference to her father being in Kronsweide.  The Grandma Database says she was married in Kronsweide (in 1802 which makes no sense given her age). Her death date is from the Grandma Database.  She was in Schonwiese in 1795. David's daughter Maria is listed in the Reinlaender Gemeinde Buch.  Her death date is taken from H. Schapansky.  The Reinlaender Gemeinde Book gives a different death date in the same year.  The information about her parents is taken from Stan Harder's research and verified through separate research as outlined in Maria Fehr's notes.  According to Stan Harder her sister Anne was born in Kronsweide; probably Maria was born there as well.  She died before the waves of migration to Canada began.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">He came to Ukraine in 1821 (Peter Rempel identifies the family) and settled in Tiegenhagen, Molotschna. The 1835 Molotschna Census confirms that he died at Tiegenhagen #17 in 1825, leaving his wife, Maria, and son Cornelius. The census says that he was briefly in Tiegerweide, arriving in 1821 and leaving for Tiegenhagen in 1824. Peter Rempel lists him emigrating from Wernersdorf in 1821 with wife, Maria (1765), son Cornelius and daughters Gertrude (1795) and Agnetha (1802).The census gives his father's name as Cornelius.<br><br>His son Cornelius was 41 in the 1835 Molotschna Census, thus providing an approximate year of birth. I also found this son in the Heubuden Church Book. I am uncertain of the full list of children appearing in the Grandma Database. I can verify a few of them but not all of them. There was a Friedrich Fast living in Wernersorf at the same time as Cornelius and the Grandma Database has this comment about Friedrich: "His Schroop property records give his heirs (in order of birth) as: a) adults from 1st marriage: 1) Johann, 2) Peter, 3) Harm, b) minors from 1st marriage: 4) Maria and 5) Friedrich; c) minors from 2nd marriage: 6) Heinrich, 7) Franz and 8) Agnetha."

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Aganetha was the second wife of Jacob Toews according to Henry Schapansky. The marriage date of Jacob Toews and Aganetha Epp is unknown and therefore it is difficult to know if this is true, but the Martin Toews family book only indicates one marriage, Jacob to Aganetha. In 1804 only two children, Jacob and Aganetha, were with the family. Therefore their third child, Heinrich, must have been born in Ukraine. The birth dates of the first two children come from the Martin Toews family book.<br><br>Refering to the information in the notes for her husband, it appears her year of birth originated with data from the Russian archives. Also, Heinrich seems to have been born in 1817.<br><br>Aganetha's surname comes from the Martin Toews family book. Unfortunately this information does not have anything to say about her parents or other ancestors.<br><br>I speculated that she could be the daughter of Johann Epp (1750-1789) #265911 and Anna Janzen (1760-1787) #265912. This Aganetha was baptized in the Tiegenhagen Church in 1801. The Aganetha who married Toews was already a mother by this time.<br><br>Peter Rempel says the family emigrated from Sandhof. Sandhof is part of present day Marienburg. Aganetha's parents lived in Marienburg at the time of the 1776 census.<br><br>The first two children were born in Barlewitz according to the Martin Toews genealogy. This is 18km south of Marienburg.<br><br>The Grandma Database says that Aganetha was the daughter of Heinrich Epp and Margaretha Dyck, apparently based on information provided by Werner Toews. The baptisms of siblings before Aganetha are in the Gross Werder Church records (Ladekop) but Aganetha and her younger siblings are not among these records. Peter Rempel's book contains the names of all siblings except Aganetha; apparently they all moved to Ukraine with their parents. Aganetha was married to Jacob Toews by this time.<br><br>I corresponded with Werner about the information he supplied to Grandma. His information was years old and unsourced. I am using this information for now although the family document "Memoirs and the Genealogical Register of the Descendants of Heinrich David Epp" written by Jacob Epp and John Reimer in 2000 does not contain any references to Aganetha. I think it is work retaining the data because there is a genealogical record gap and Aganetha could have been caught in the gap. The eldest four children were baptised in the Ladekop church. Seven children emigrated with their parents. This represents the entire genealogical record for the family. We do not know if there were other children. Perhaps Aganetha is one and the Grandma source is accurate. If Aganetha was the first child to be married and move away from the family home, she would not appear in the family immigration records.<br><br>Werner sent me this reference (<a href="https://www.mharchives.ca/holdings/organizations/OdessaArchiveF6/F6-1.htm)">https://www.mharchives.ca/holdings/organizations/OdessaArchiveF6/F6-1.htm)</a> File 888. <br><br>File concerning an incident in which the Mennonite Jacob Toews of Ekaterinoslav petitioned to the Guardianship Office for protection from Major Fuerstenau who rented his house.

Stumpp gives a birth year of 1754 and also mentions that he came with his son David who was born in 1789.  Stumpp says Wilhelm was a "bauer", meaning a labourer. The 1806 Chortitza Census indicates he settled in Rosenthal in 1795 with his wife, two sons and a daughter. In the 1811 Chortitza Census his occupation is listed as weaver.  By 1811 his daughter, 20 years old, is married and her husband, Julius Martens, is living with Wilhelm's family. In 1814 his daughter and son in law have moved out. Son David has married Katharina and has two children, David (it appears his real name was Wilhelm and the census contained an error) and Anna.<br><br>Wilhelm had two foster children living with him.

Stumpp confirms their origin, and says he was a farmer in Rehwalde.  He lived in Rosenthal until at least 1808. Rempel list him in Rosenthal in 1797 with a house, eight horses and twenty head of cattle.  He was an original settler in Rosenthal according to Rempel.  There is a Niclas Wieler mentioned in Schoenhorst in the 12 August 1809 Chortitza smallpox vaccination list with a one year old son.  This is probably the same individual, since H.

<p style="margin-left:1in">There are two important Epp genealogy publications that form the basis for tracing the Epp lineage back to the seventeenth century. Corelius Epp and Orval Ens published "Jacob Epp and Elizabeth (Ens) Epp Genealogy 1845-1987" and Orval Ens, as Chair of a committee, published "Heinrich and Margaretha Epp Genealogy 1855-1984". Jacob Epp (1845) and Heinrich Epp (1855) were cousins. Their fathers, Jacob Epp (1823) and Heinrich Epp (1826) were brothers, sons of Peter Epp (1798). When I obtained copies of these genealogy publications, I sought and received confirmation of these relationships from Amy Ens, sister of Orval Ens.<br><br>The Jacob Epp and Elizabeth Ens Genealogy book an English translation of a Citizenship Certificate issued by the Chortitza Municipal Administration (Jekaterinoslaw) on 3 June 1916.  This document tells us that Peter's (1798) father was Peter Epp (1777) who was registered in the village of Chortitza in 1816.  The specific facts contained in the certificate are these:<br><br>(1) David Epp, born 1858, was the son of Jacob Epp and in 1916 he lived in Schoenhorst (Wodjanoj) [Ed. Jacob Epp was born in 1823].<br>(2) Jacob Epp lived in Schoeneberg (Smoljanoj) in 1858 and transferred to Schoenhorst in 1869.<br>(3) David was the grandson of Peter Epp who lived in the village of Chortitza in 1835 and transferred out to Schoeneberg in 1853 [Ed. Peter Epp was born in 1798].<br>(4) David was the great grandson of Peter Epp who moved to Imperial Russia in 1789 and was living in the village of Chortitza in 1816 [Ed. Peter Epp was born in 1777].<br><br>In summary:<br><br>David Epp (1858) in Schoenhorst 1916<br>Jacob Epp (1823) in Schoeneberg 1852 and Schoenhorst 1869<br>Peter Epp (1798) in Chortitza 1835 and Schoeneberg 1853<br>Peter Epp (1777) in Chortitza 1816<br><br>Tracing Peter Epp (1777) through the census records we see that he was at Rosenthal #16 in 1797, Neuendorf #17 in 1807, Neuendorf #13 in 1808, Chortitza #17 (landless) in May 1814, Chortitza #16 (landless) in October 1814, Chortitza #56 in 1815, Chortitza #21 (landless) in May 1816 and finally at Schoenweise #1 (landless) in October 1816. <br><br>Stumpp and Unruh document a Peter Epp (1777) in Neuendorf in 1808. In fact, he was at Neuendorf #17 in 1807 and at #13 (landless) in 1808 holding a job as a schoolteacher. He was the son of Heinrich Epp (1757). Peter Epp (1777) had a son named Peter (1798) who remained in Neuendorf as a servant of Peter Isaac when the family moved to Chortitza after 1811.<br><br>We find his son Peter (1798) working for Peter Isaac through 1816. Later the Schoenhorst Church Register tells us that Peter Epp married Helena Goertzen and were the parents of Jacob Epp (1823). This corresponds to the Epp-Ens Genealogy.<br> <br>I have estimated the wedding date for Peter (1777) and Catharina from the available census material.  In Glenn Penner's list of original settlers to Chortitza, Martin Ens has a group of six people in his household in 1795. The 1797 Chortitza Census shows that he now has a household of five people. His daughter Catharina would represent the reduction if she became married between 1795 and 1797.  Later when Martin died, around 1802, his farm in Rosenthal passed to his daughter and her husband, Peter Epp.<br> <br>Peter's father, Heinrich, is on Glenn Penner's list of families who came to Ukraine in 1795. Peter would likely have been in the household.<br> <br>There is a Peter Epp in Schoeneberg in the 1859 Chortitza Colony census. Further the 1863 Grain List has Peter Epp listed as a local resident (as distinct from a farmer) in Schoeneberg. This Peter Epp is the grandfather of David, mentioned above and the data corresponds to the Citizenship Certificate.<br> <br>The Schoenhorst Church Book lists Jacob Epp and his wife Helena Klassen. It also says that Jacob's parents were Peter Epp and Helena Goerzen.  This puts Jacob in Schoenhorst, and this data matches the certificate.  The details in the Schoenhorst Church Book for Jacob and Helena, including the details of their children, match the Epp-Ens genealogy material, providing assurance that we have the correct couple. It is interesting that the name given for Jacob's mother is Goerzen rather than Gossen as provided in the Epp-Ens genealogy.  Glenn Penner has pointed out that Goerzen and Gossen are not interchangeable versions of the same name. I asked Orval Ens about this discrepancy, and he told me the name was uncertain because they had no source documents and relied on faint recollection. He felt that Goerzen was probably correct.<br> <br>The 1920 Census of Chortitza lists Jacob's youngest daughter Anna (born 1865) in Schoenhorst.  Her married name is Enns but there is no husband listed.  She had four children living with her at this time. The precise date of death used for Anna was provided by a contributor to the Grandma Database.<br> <br>The Epp-Ens publication tells us that Grandfather Peter Epp was born prior to 1789.  This would appear to be incorrect. Rather it is great grandfather Peter Epp who was born before 1789.<br> <br>I found some interesting information on the web in a pdf document assembled by Herman Thiessen based on Erma Schemenauer's work.  This lists all the children of Jacob (born 1823) and has dates of death for most.  It also speculates that Jacob's daughters Katherina and Helena were murdered on 5 December 1919.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Given the age difference between George Goertzen and his wife Maria Neubauer it seems logical that she was his second wife. This is what the Tiegenhagen Church Book implies where it lists the death of his first, unnamed, wife on 21 June 1784. This record and the record of his marriage to Maria tell us he was from the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde. I have assumed this is where he was born. George died at the age of 83 according to the Tiegenhagen Church Book. This leads to his calculated year of birth.<br><br>There is some speculation that there are two individuals named George Goertzen, a father and a son, and Maria married the son. This helps to explain the significant age difference between George and Maria. However, the evidence in the Tiegenhagen Church Book, interpreted in the most simple way, appears to contradict this hypothesis of two men. It appears to me that the elder George lost his wife in June 1784 and quickly remarried in September of that year. At the time he had at least two children still at home (they were unbaptized), although they were not infants. The Grandma Database lists three children from George's first marriage but I can find only two, Abraham and Cornelius, in the baptism records, along with a daughter Anna who is not listed in the Grandma Database. I also believe that if there was a son named George he would appear in the baptism records in the years before 1784 when the marriage of Maria Neubauer took place.<br><br>I am puzzled by the data in the 1772 and 1776 census records. In 1772 George has 1 son over age 12 and 2 sons under age 12, and no daughters. In 1776 he has no children at all. Abraham and Cornelius would have been born around 1766 and 1764 respectively, accounting for the 2 younger sons. Anna would have been born around 1762, although possibly earlier. Possibly the 1772 census is in error and the elder child should have been recorded as a daughter.<br><br>The Grandma Database says George's first wife was named Anna. There is no source reference for this. I wonder if the name was picked up from the Tiegenhagen bapatism records and the name of George's daughter was mistakenly used as the name of the wife.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Peter Regehr is one of the original settlers who came to Ukraine in 1789. He is listed with a wife and a child. However, in the 1795 the only child listed is Peter who was born around 1793. There must have been an earlier child who died before 1793.<br><br>His first wife was Susanna. I am using the approximate year of birth based on Unruh and his 1795 Revision List. She immigrated to Chortitza in 1789.<br><br>The facts about Peter are quite clear. He lived with his parents in Schoensee in 1772. His age there is recorded as 27, making his year of birth 1745. This is unlikely because future census records indicate he was born around 1750. That said, we can be fairly certain we have the correct man identified here because Unruh confirms he came to the Chortitza settlement from Schoensee and he is the only person in the 1772 census with that name. He must have been still living in Schoensee in 1776 and thereafter until he left for the new settlement. The First Settler list records his household as containing two adults and one child. Therefore we know that he had been married before 1789 and had one child at that point. Unruh traces him from 1795 to 1808. In 1795 he lived at Neuendorf with his wife, Susanna (1767), and son, Peter (1793). The child's age implies that the first child had died before the census. In 1802 he still lives in Neuendorf but Susanna has died and his son, Peter, is now given a birth year of 1799, implying the earlier son died before 1799. In 1808 he remains in Neuendorf and now is listed with a wife named Maria (1775), the same son Peter, a daughter named Maria (1806), and a son named Johann (1807).<br><br>Note that Henry Schapansky has suggested that Peter was the son of Michael Regehr of Schoensee. However this is doubtful because he is not listed with Michael's family in the census of 1772.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">He was a Flemish Mennonite from Petershagen, Tiegenhagen Gemeinde.  H. Schapansky says his father was Berhend Rempel from Petershagen and this is possible - there is a Berhend in the 1776 census.  However, Nikolai Rempel in "Das Rempelfamilienbuch" says his father is Peter and this is the source I have used.  This is also how the Grandma Database records his ancestry. Apparently Judii Rempel and others believe this to be accurate. The source I used writes his name as Peter Peter D Rempel which further points to a father named Peter and a mother whose surname begins with "D", consistent with his mother's name - Dyck or von Dyck.  <br><br>The marriage location is based on the location of the birth of his first child with Margaretha Teichroeb.  Peter was in Schoenhorst in 1793 and 1795, in Chortitza between 1802 and 1806 and in Osterwick in 1814.  He appears in the 1801 census in Chortitza Village.  The Grandma Database indicates he died in Schoenhorst but there is no evidence of this. The last village he lived in that is documented was Neu-Osterwick in 1816. The date of death is based on calculations from the David Epp diary.  <br><br>There is some question about the number of wives he had; many sources say his first wife was the widow Loewen, his second wife was Kornelia and Margaretha was his third wife.  The 1801 census is specific that his first wife was Kornelia and Margaretha was his second wife. Nikolai Rempel records three wives and his data doesn't match the facts recorded in the 1801 census. I have relied on the census data.<br><br>Kornelia's family name could be Loewen based on information in the Geni World Family Tree database. However she could also be the widow Loewen.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">In the 1806 Chortitza Colony Census she is listed as a widow in Burwalde.  Her first name is incorrectly given as Maria in that census. In 1807 her name is correctly listed with her new husband. Her baptism in 1786 is recorded in the Elbing baptism records along with her brother Michael, both shown as surviving children of Phillip and living with stepfather Loewen.<br><br>Her husband Gerhard died before 1806 and vanishes from the census records.  Aganetha appears in 1806 in Burwalde having taken on ownership of the farm owned previously by Jacob Harder.  She has one son and three daughters with her.  Based on Unruh it appears that her husband Gerhard first got Harder's farm prior to 1802 when Harder died and his widow married Simon Loewen. In 1807 she is in Burwalde with her new husband Cornelius Funk.  Her son Gerhard and daughters Maria and Agnetha are with her. She died before the 1811 Census and her children are no longer in the census. Her husband Cornelius has a new wife named Helena.<br><br>An interesting relationship emerges here. Jacob Harder, whose farm Gerhard took over, was married to Agatha Penner who is a great grandmother of Johann Striemer (1859). Gerhard is a great grandfather of Johann Striemer.<br><br>Aganetha's son Jacob Warkentin migrated from Elbing, Prussia to eastern Ukraine between 1801 and 1808 according to the Grandma Database. In the 1808 and 1816 Chortitza Colony Census records he is listed at Burwalde. In the 1847 Chortitza Colony Heads of Households list he is listed in Rosengart. <br><br>I noted that the Grandma Database says Aganetha had a son Peter Warkentin #197487 born in 1785. This information has no source and Henry Schapansky doesn't list this person. I also noted that Schapansky lists a son Johann Funk born in 1813. I suppose this is possible but she would have been over 50 at the time. I have not seen this person in the Chortitza Census.<br><br>Aganetha's third husband, Cornelius Funk, emigrated from Wengelen, Kleinwerder, Prussia to Ukraine in 1804 with his parents.  In the 1808 and 1814 Chortitza Colony censuses he is listed at Burwalde.  In the 1808 census his age is given as 26, suggesting that he was born around 1782 and in the 1814 census his age is given as 35, suggesting that he was born around 1781.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">In the 1806 Chortitza Colony Census he is listed in Chortitza at which point there were 5 males and 3 females in his household.  In the October 1814 Chortitza Colony Census he is listed at Chortitza. The 1815 census entry says he entered Ukraine in 1804. I think he is the Johann that is seen in Rempel's book accompanying his brother Peter in transit to Russia in 1803. Peter went to Molotschna and by 1808 his brother was no longer with him. I think this is because Johann stayed in Chortitza from the outset, getting married and homesteading there. Johann and Peter came from Reimerswald and were members of the Tiegenhagen Gemeinde according to the record in Unruh related to Peter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">The Grandma Database says that her father was the Peter Penner to which I have her linked here.  I think her mother was Elscke Woelke based on accumulated information in the Danzig Church Book. Agatha was baptized in the Marienburg area. This corresponds with what we know about her father. He was baptized in 1762 and married Elscke in 1762; she died in 1764; he died in the "rural" area in 1786. This corresponds with the idea that he moved out to the Marienburg area after Elscke died. <br><br>I believe Agatha came to Ukraine with her first husband, Jacob Harder, in 1789.

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">He was a Flemish Mennonite. He is listed in the 1789 land census as a landowner in Klein Mausdorf, Elbing.  <br><br>According to Peter Rempel and Benjamin Unruh he came to Ukraine in 1789. However, Glenn Penner's research does not find a record of him in the 1789 immigration data, although there are records of his brothers David and Jacob. I wonder if Wilhelm was with one of his brothers at the time of the immigration (probably Jacob). The list of 228 original families shows Jacob as a household head, with a family of 3 adults. This could be a family consisting of Jacob, his wife, and his brother Wilhelm; Jacob did not have children at the time. In the 1795 Census his brother Jacob, and his family, are living with Wilhelm's family. This corresponds to a record in Unruh saying that Jacob had given his property to Wilhelm. Wilhelm appears in Schoenhorst in 1795, 1801 and 1802, Nieder-Chortitza in 1803 and 1814 and The Bergthal Gemeinde Buch.  The 1801 Chortitza census lists him as a tailor and Unruh lists him as a tailor in 1814.  According to the 1801 census he and his wife were the same age and born around 1767. In Unruh his name sometimes appears as Isbrecht.  He was baptized while in Heubuden. <br><br>If Wilhelm did arrive with his brother, then he married Maria Klassen in the new settlement. This would exlain the family count for her father Franz in the list of 228 settlers: four adults and two children representing Franz and wife Susanna plus the two elder daughters and the two surviving children.  <br><br>He was living in Nieder Chortitza as recorded in successive census documents through 1816.<br><br>Henry Schapansky feels that Wilhelm's father was a Wilhelm but it is difficult to know which one.  Schapansky links Wilhelm, Jacob and David as brothers.  It seems clear that Wilhelm and Jacob are brothers based on the Schoenhorst comment to the effect they actually were siblings. Whether David is a brother is open to question because there is quite a substantial age gap, David being born around 1750 whereas Jacob was born around 1764 and Wilhelm two or three years later. The DNA evidence says that Wilhelm was in a different haplogroup from David.  That probably is definitive in disproving their relationship as siblings. <br><br>Linking Wilhelm to the senior Wilhelm is a speculative exercise. In the 1776 census there is a Wilhelm living in Klein Mausdorf. The common geographic data is potentially significant.<br><br>Wilhelm's second wife was Katharina Braun. Her only child was born in 1818 and this demonstrates she was not his first wife.</p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">Peter Rempel indicates that he migrated to Neuendorf in Ukraine in 1789. Unruh lists him in 1789 married to Agatha Thimm. This conflicts with the information Glenn Penner has published about the first settlers in Ukraine where Abraham is not present. It is possible he immigrated with another family. He migrated from Krebsfelde, Prussia to Ukraine sometime between 1789 and 1795.  He is listed at Neuendorf in 1795, 1801, 1802, 1808 and 1814. His first wife was Agatha Thimm, who originally was married to Cornelius Hiebert.  Cornelius died not long after reaching Ukraine and Agatha remarried to Abraham. They took over the Hiebert farm. After Agatha died Abraham married once more to a Sara Suckau sometime around 1803 and had a few more children. My dating of the marriage to Sara is based on the children's ages.  After Agatha's son Abraham was born in 1791 there is a gap of 12 years before the next child appears in 1803. I surmise that this was the first child of the marriage to Sara. The Grandma Database seems to agree.<br><br>There is an unsubstantiated online record indicating he died in 1811. This seems incorrect because the information about him demonstrates that he had children as recently as 1821.<br><br>Regarding the date of immigration, Abraham and Agatha had a child in 1791-2. Since the first wave of immigration was in 1789 and the second did not occur until 1793, Abraham must have arrived in the first wave with another family.<br><br>There is a baptism record for Abraham, surviving son of Heinrich Dyck in 1788 in the Rosenort Gemeinde Baptism Records.<br><br>They remained in Neuendorf although Unruh indicates they were in Neuenburg in 1803.  The 1807 census is quite clear that Abraham was in Neuendorf with Sara and his children, as well as his mother Judith Preuss.<br><br>Generally the people in the Lackendorf area would have been members of the Flemish Rosenort congregation.</p>
