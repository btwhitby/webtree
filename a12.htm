Gijsbert DeVeer</b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#646"><sup>646</sup></a> son of <a href="a13.htm#i208"><b>Gijsbert DeVeer</a></b> <A HREF="sources.htm#674"><sup>674</sup></a> and <a href="a13.htm#i209"><b>Debora Harnasveger</a></b>,<A HREF="sources.htm#675"><sup>675</sup></a> was born 7 November 1600 in Amsterdam, Netherlands and died 16 February 1646 in Poggenpfuhl, Danzig Region, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
<br>
<p style="margin-left:1in">The Nederlandsche Leeuw is the primary source for information about Gijsbert. It tells us that Gijsbert (1600-1646) was born in Amsterdam. His parents had returned there from Danzig when his father became a citizen of Amsterdam around 1600-1601. His father was a grain merchant in Amsterdam and Danzig. <br><br>Gijsbert lived and died in Danzig. Both of his marriages were there and his children were born there. His first marriage was to Anna van Buygen who was 11 years his senior. She died only 2 years after they married. His only child with Anna was a boy named Gijsbert who died as a young child. Gijsbert remarried a year later to Maria van Dijck and all of his surviving children were from this marriage. One of those children was a son they named Gijsbert (1640-1693). <br><br>Three of the children of Gijsbert (1600-1646), Philip, Gijsbert and Agneta, married children of Wilhelm Von Roy. It appears that the De Veer family made numerous strategic marriage decisions for commercial reasons. Beyond these relationships with the wealthy Von Roy family, who also had marital links to the wealthy Koenigsberg Marun family, there were a number of marriages between De Veer children and De Momper children. These will be described in the notes relating to Gijsbert (1640-1693).<br><br>His son Philipp was an important broker for trade and exchange in Klein Mausdorf, west of Elbing. The date of Philipp's marriage to Magdalena von Roy is stated in the Grandma Database to be 1682; however I can not substantiate this. Philipp's location is important in relation to the whereabouts of a future descendant, Benjamin de Veer. If the de Veer family had a base in Klein Mausdorf, it might explain where Benjamin grew up if he was an orphan.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in">Joachim von Roy says that he was probably a trader in Elbing and not a manufacturer of trimmings. Another genealogist, Volker Ohliger, says "He was probably a merchant and trader in Elbing. The family's origins are obscure. Around 1612 almost all family members were of the Reformed faith. It was only when the three siblings Magdalena, Katharina and Peter von Roy married the three siblings Philipp, Giesbert and Aganetha de Veer and that branch of the family turned to the Mennonite faith. The other family members remained reformed."<br><br>His son Peter is a brother to Katarina Von Roy. Herman Thiessen puts his birth date at about 1640 (Hermann Thiessen Film 25, Folder 12, Page 204) but I am going with the date of 1644 from the Nederlandsche Leeuw.  I note that in the Grandma Database a woman who died in Danzig in 1669, referred to in the Danzig Church Book only as the wife of Von Roy, is identified as Peter's wife.  I doubt this is correct. De Nederlandsche Leeuw mentions nothing about Peter having a previous wife, nor does Joachim von Roy. Joachim von Roy says he was a merchant and handler in the silk and gold trade in Neugarten, as well as the owner of a manufactory for the production of gold, silver and silk trim. He apparently testified on 27 February 1690 before the Council of the City of Danzig that the brothers Cornelius and Gysbert in Alt Schottland, sons of the deceased married couple Gysbert and Maria De Veer, were the sole heirs of their recently deceased, unmarried, sister, Maria De Veer.<br><br>I have seen family trees online that include Elisabeth Niklassen as Wilhelm's wife. This is probably carried over from the records of Jan von Roy in Nederlandsche Leeuw who is shown with Elisabeth as his wife. There is no information that I am aware of to substantiate a relationship between Elisabeth and Wilhelm. However it strikes me as possible that although there is confusion about the husband's name, which I believe to be Wilhelm based on Joachim von Roy's research, the wife's name could be correct. Accordingly I have associated her with Wilhelm.<br><br>Notes about his family<br><br>Son Johann was the owner of a factory for the production of gold, sliver and silk trim. His death is recorded in the list of Mennonite deaths in the Elbing St. Annen Lutheran Church. He is buried in the cemetery of the St Anne Church in Elbing. Apparently his descendants appear occasionally in the Elbing records.<br><br>The Nederlandsche Leeuw gives the name of his daughter Magdalena as Magdalena von Rise but the Danzig Church Book gives her name as Magdalena von Roy in her death record, in association with her husband Phillip de Veer and in accordance with Joachim Von Roy.</p>
