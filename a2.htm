<p style="margin-left:1in">Marjorie was born in Rabbit Lake when her father worked in the area as a farm hand.  They moved to Laird and then to Waldheim.  The original house in Waldheim was made of sod and she remembers her mother "mudding" the interior to keep the walls sealed.  Over time they constructed a new house from a pair of old granaries.  For a time there was just a single granary and a tarp to close off the open end while the house awaited the second building.  She remembers getting electricity when she was in Grade 10; until then kerosene lamps and a fire stove were the energy sources.<br><br>Between Grades 9 and 10 she worked out in BC picking fruit at her uncle Armin's place and other orchards in the area. After Grade 10 she worked at the old Red &amp; White store in Waldheim along with helping Helena with her small laundry business.</p>
